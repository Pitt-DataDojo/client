I will do my best, and if you wish to email me with a request for specific info, I will be happy to help.  I was seeing a psychiatrist 9 years ago who thought Effexor was worth a try.  I had been on Prozac a few yrs previous, and although it worked really well, after taking it for two years I developed the side effect of experiencing arthritic pain in my hands.  That was the reason I discontinued the use of Prozac. After being off the Prozac or any other meds for a year or two, I could feel myself sliding back into the black hole of depression and severe anxiety.  I found a doctor (psychiatrist)and he put me on Effexor.  It was a miracle.  I was soooo happy to find something that worked so well, and on the first try. (Several years before, I had gone through what my family refers to as the ""year of hell,"" when I first began the journey of searching for an anti-depressant that would work AND not have side effects that kept me from functioning normally.) My treatment consisted of: Taking the 300 mg of effexor, and monthly visits to my psychiatrist to determine how well my effexor was working and to discuss other treatment options. Although I could notice a marked difference in my mood, I still felt that I wasn't nearly as healthy mentally as I needed to be.  I would still have days when I felt ""paralyzed"" and very anxious.  When I discussed the problem with my psych., he suggested that I add Luvox, another anti-depressant, to my regimen.  That helped as well, although there were two unpleasant side effects: 1) loss of sex drive and difficulty achieving orgasm, and 2) night sweats.  My doc prescribed 1 mg of hytrin for the night sweats; it worked, and he recommended 60 mg. ginko biloba daily for the loss of sex drive.  It may have helped a little, but I was never quite sure. One other thing I found beneficial for my anxiety was 10 mg. dexadrine.  It seemed contradictory to me that a stimulant would calm me down, but the very first day I took it, I felt calm for the first time in my life. Up until then I didn't realize how severe my anxiety was, because I had never known what it was like to be without it. But that very first day I took it, I felt a calmness come over me that was such a relief.  Always before, I had a feeling inside that I can only explain as the feeling one would get if one was late for an important meeting with one's boss.  Sort of like, ""I'm late! Gotta hurry! oh, no!""  That was a feeling that I had always had, and it had nothing to do with what my situation was-- late or early, it made no difference.  For the first two weeks I took the Dexadrine, I didn't pull my hair (trichotillomania)at all, nor did I even realize I wasn't pulling, as I didn't even think about it.  Unfortunately, I did go back to pulling after that. The 2 side effects I experienced with the dex. is that 1) it made me drowsy for about the first hour after I took it, and 2) it made me feel like I lost my spontaneity.  I got a lot more done, and I didn't feel so panicked, but I wasn't as much fun.  For that reason, I stopped taking it regularly and took it maybe only half of the time.  After maybe a year or two I quit taking it altogether and when I went back on it last year after having been off of it for about 5 years, it no longer worked as it had before.  It made me feel jittery as though I'd had way too much coffee.  It just made the anxiety worse.

I'm not sure if I was supposed to tell about more than one medication for this survey. However, these four meds I've mentioned were all sort of intertwined, so it seemed appropriate for me to do so.

Granted, it was after I stopped taking the medication that this ""cure"" took place, but I never experienced this with other anti-depressants. While taking it, Effexor made me so sleepy all the time that I slept a good deal more than normal (10-12 hours daily). This is why I stopped taking it. But when I did, I felt better than I had in years. I remained depression-free for about 3 years. I then dealt with depression again for about 8-10 months (I didn't want to lose another 6-8 weeks taking the Effexor ""cure"" so I delayed, hoping I would just ""snap out of it"" on my own). When I finally conceded this wasn't going to happen, I returned to my doctor, who then convinced me to try something new, so I tried Cymbalta, hoping to get Effexor's benefits, without the side-effects.

My depression took the form of a lack of interest in all aspects of my life and I had begun to ""shut down"" to such a degree that sometimes the act of just walking from the garage into my house required a strong act of will. When I had to run errands, like grocery shopping, I felt an uncomfortable detachment from my environment. My treatment with Effexor, at worst, sometimes simply took me down (energy-wise) an additional notch from where I was. At best, it shifted me from the uncomfortable detached feeling and elevated my mood a couple of notches above where it had been. I had moments of feeling fully functional. That was enough to give me a sense of feeling better, and the will to decide to take my full energy back. That's when I stopped taking it, and experienced the miraculous ""cure"". If I ever experience such a deep depression again, I will choose to try the Effexor again (the original, not the newer version), rather than the Cymbalta.

I am extremely sensitive to medication, so I started at a dose of 25 mgs. and slowly titrated up to 100 mgs. I was unaware that this was probably too high of a dose for me. It subsequently caused me to start taking other prescriptions to mitigate some side effects. My doctor prescribed Ritalin and Focalin for the lethargy and fatigue side effects that I experienced during the day, and Ambien for the insomnia that Zoloft caused. I am still on Ambien to this day. 

The worst effect of Zoloft came when I tried to get off of it. It was total, utter hell. I have since found out that this is euphemistically called, ""discontinuation Syndrome."" 

I first cut the dose down to 50 mgs. and did not experience problems. I then slowly titrated down over several months until I came off of it completely. Over the next few weeks, I started experiencing strange, tingling sensations down my body, panic attacks, (which I had never experienced before), and extreme nausea - which became so bad, I lost 20 pounds in 6 weeks. This was all extremely traumatic as I am a type 1 diabetic who needs to eat to balance the insulin I take. The panic attacks got so bad, I had to be on Xanax XR everyday for months. I could not function normally or work. I tried to stick it out because I didn't want to go back on an SSRI after all the trouble and side effects it caused. I went to a MD who was also an alternative care specialist, thinking he could give me St. Johns Wort and I could manage with that until I got over the physical side effects of the SSRI, but it didn't work. I eventually had to go back on an SSRI just to function normally. I am on Lexapro now. I managed to be drug free for the first 40 years of my life (except for insulin), and now because of the aftermath of Zoloft, I am on Ambien, Lexapro, and Valium occasionally for anxiety. To top that off, the alternative doctor put me on a supplement that ended up being an anabolic steroid (which he called a 'nutritional supplement' and I ended up having to go on even more medication to fight the side effects that I incurred from that. All because of Zoloft. I will regret taking it the rest of my life.",6,1,0
