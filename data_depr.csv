elavil,10,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,"Although this drug was originally prescribed for depression, it helped with sleeplessness. Therefore, I have continued to take it for that alone. While I still on occasion have problems falling asleep, I find I can combine it with Melatonin or Valerian. In 12 years, I haven't had to increase the elavil dosage.",None.,"One a day, taken about an hour before bedtime."
sarafem,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,I found that this drug helps significantly with my level of depression and monthly irritability that occurs around my menstrual cycles.,"My sides effects were not noticeable and very mild.  I have noticed some lower libido while on Fluoxetine, but no other noticeable side effects.","This was prescribes to me for treatment for depression, seasonable disorder and hormonal irritability.   I have gone off this medication while pregnant, but have resumed to help ease depression issues."
wellbutrin,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"I have taken antidepressants for many years, and this is first that did not ""flip the switch"" on sexuality.  I no longer feel like I am looking out of a dark room.  I have more energy, feel more motivated, and overall function at a higher level than before.","A little bit of ""hyper"" feelings.  I take the entire dose at one time, daily, and have been advised that the feeling of being revved up would disspiate if I did take it in two or more doses during the day.  I try to minimize the effect by taking the medication first thing in the morning.","I suffer chronic depression and the Wellbutrin is the first antidepressant that did not sedate me, and the only that did not dampen sexual feelings.  I have taken tricyclics (sp?) which were extremely sedating as well as limiting as far as OTC medications and dietary restrictions.  I have also tried SSRIs (prozac, zoloft, etc.)and while they temporarily relieved my depression, 1) the effect did not last more than 6 months, and 2) they completely destroyed my libido."
prozac,7,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"relieves depression, helps other things such as sleep, dieting, exercise, relationships, responses to stimulous.  The cost is lower than other antidepressants which can be a help to those on a budget.",Sleepy and lack of response to problems.  Took too long to get started.  I think anyone else would think it wasn't effective and stop taking it.,"took a seemingly long period of time to become effective.  Once started, however, it did what I expected.  It is hard to be without now and think that it will be a problem stopping in the future."
lexapro,6,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Before I started on the drug Lexapro, I felt lethargic and didn't want to get out of bed each morning. I hated getting up and facing the day. I would sit and watch the time pass by. Finally, I went to my Dr. for a checkup and he diagnosed me as being depressed. He put me on Wellbutrin and Lexapro 10 mg. I was instructed to take the pill 2 times per day everyday. For the first week I felt disconnected from myself but by the 2nd week I started to feel as if each morning was something to look forward to. I believe that Lexapro was a great addition to my life during my troubled times.",In the first week of treatment I felt disconnected from myself. I felt fuzzy and had trouble thinking clearly. It was this side effect that made me not want to take the drug anymore but I continued taking it 2 times per day. By the second week the fuzziness began to lift and I felt more like my normal self. After 2 months of taking Lexapro I felt like I was back to my old self again.,Lexapro was taken 2 times a day for 2 months.
wellbutrin-xl,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"The Wellbutrin with 20 mg of Prozac daily as an adjunct alleviated most symptoms of depression.  Better sleep as a result, and more energy throughout the day.","Jitters, trembling hands.","I had been taking Prozac with other medications for 10 years and it had stopped working for me.  After being prescribed Wellbutrin with it, I found I felt so much better.  However, when I tried to stop taking Prozac entirely and stay just on the Wellbutrin, my depression returned.  I have been on this cocktail now for 5 years and believe it has helped me immensly."
wellbutrin-sr,5,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"decreased appetite, help to stop abusing alcohol","muscle aches, shakes, increased anxiety, strange thoughts, blurred vision","plan to keep taking and hope side effects decrease over time, possibly increasing dose, taking xanax to help with anxiety.  Took paxil and lexapro in past, gave me suicidal thoughts and actions when drinking alcohol with them.  Decided ssri's are not for me. keep hoping wellbutrin will help soon."
zoloft,6,Moderately Effective,No Side Effects,"Moderate lifting of depressive episode, made it so I could function better in everyday life.",None that I could detect. Nothing noticeable. Maybe just a bit more insomnia but I had that before taking Zoloft.,"I went to my internist and told him that I wanted to be put on a low dose of an antidepressant and something for my anxiety . I had been on Effexor for many years, awile ago. Effexor worked but the withdrawal symptoms were horrible, even if I so much as missed a dose. Perhaps it was a placebo effect, but I felt the Zoloft working after about a week. Nothing earth shattering,but noticeable."
zoloft,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,relaxed,tired,Taking zoloft once a day IF YOU ARE REALLY DEPRESSED may work wonders. But try to gat off of it as soon as possible. Long term side effects are still not known.
prozac,3,Marginally Effective,Severe Side Effects,According to her & what I was able to observe  there was not much benefits to this treatment  .,"There was terrible side effects while on the treatment  but even worst when she tried to stop the medication.  While on the treatment the worst side effect was the suicidal thoughts   .  Also  constant dry mouth , headaches .
   when she discontinued the treatment   the dizziness  & the ringing in the ears were unbearable .","She had to take anti-nauseated pills  for the nausea  , dizziness  plus other   pills for the ringing in the ears . 

 She succeeded after two   agonizing months  & will never take prozac again.
 
 I think every doctor should inform patients of the withdrawal side effects of this  drug ."
paxil,6,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,A more positive outlook and much easier social interaction.  Introversion diminished and friendly extroversion became more natural.  It was easier to start and finish projects because energy previously wasted on negative thoughts and actions was now available for constructive purposes.,"A total loss of any sexual sensation.  Prior to treatment interest in sex was low but paradoxically, when a feeling of psychological well-being produced a renewed interest in sex, the drug also removed the physical ability to engage in it.  Orgasm was impossible and physical arousal was too weak to be effective. 
The worst part was withdrawal following treatment.  It took at least 6 months of extremely gradual tapering off to withdraw, and I was on a low dose.  Any attempt to withdraw faster would produce chaotic mood swings from hysterical laughter to violent, yelling rages.  Every emotion, however mild, was magnified exponentially.  Sexual sensation also went off the scale with such hypersensitivity that ejaculations happened spontaneously without any physical stimulation - a sneeze or a yawning stretch would morph into an immediate ejaculating orgasm without any erection.  Throughout the withdrawal period a sensation of electric brain shocks extending to the arms and trunk would accompany any quick eye movement.","Just the one pill each morning.  This medication is such a double-edged sword that I could not recommend it.  The long term dangers of sustained treatment are too great, as evidenced by the severe withdrawal effects.  It really 'rewires' your brain and those effects may be unpredictable from person to person."
effexor-xr,5,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Wasn't as severly depressed as before taking the drug, didn't sleep as much and was able to function normally in a job.","nightmares, some drowsiness during the day, minor weight gain","Took the medication in the mornings

tried to discontinue the medication gradually, but had severe side effects including electric like shocks"
lexapro,1,Moderately Effective,Severe Side Effects,I felt less sadness.,"i felt less of every emotion.  i felt emotionally flat.  Slept a lot.  When I wasn't sleeping, I really could not even have driven a car.  Made me a zombie.","I took a whole 10 mg tablet the first time and I wasn't right for two days.  I then took just a quarter of a 10 mg tablet and got the same reaction, but it only lasted for about a day. I was through with it a that point."
zoloft,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"After about two weeks of being on the medicine, I started to feel a little better but I think it takes awhile for it to really kick in. The medicine has helped me by the following:
Lessened depression, better overall mood, slightly less irritable and sensitive, better able to function daily","occasional headaches and nausea,occasional ticking noise in the back of my head, and decreased sex drive,",I was diagnosed with severe depression after attempted suicide.
lexapro,7,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Taking Lexapro has become a staple in my life.  I come from an extremely depressed family history including suicide in the family and extreme bi-polar disorder in my father.  Without some kind of anti-depressant I literally cannot sleep at night due to low positive brain chemicals causing me to wake every few hours and have a very hard time falling asleep.  Therefore I take 15 mg prophylactically of Lexapro long-term.  I would rather not be on anything at all but unfortunately have tried that in the past without success.  I do think this drug can be very good if it helps you, though it is not a cure all by any means.","The side effects for me included slightly lowered sex drive but not completely gone and climax is still possible.  I am drowsier on this drug than I was before and have lost some of my motivation regarding goals and dreams.  However, it is worth it to also lose the insomnia and crying spells.","I have tried 20 mg per day in divided doses (10 mg a.m. and 10 mg before bed at night) as well as 15 mg per day administered once in the morning.  I prefer the 15 mg although the 20 does work a little better as long as I divide the doses.  I am staying at 15 because I would like to take as small a dose as possible while still managing my depression symptoms.  I was happier overall on 20 mg however.  Oddly enough, taking 20 mg once in the morning rather than divided into a.m. and p.m. seemed to make my depression worse and I found myself crying more.  All in all the best for me is 20 mg with half in the morning and half at night.  However, for long term use I prefer to take 15 mg just once per day at night."
paxil,1,Moderately Effective,Severe Side Effects,overall more at ease mantally was the only true benefit I felt.,"I was sweating all the time, also loss of appetite and sex drive. Uncomfortable in my skin. Constipation. Horrible to stop taking. Very hard to lessen the dosage and not feel like I was shaking out of my skin. Very edgy, trembles.",I was being treated for adult rheumatic fever with antibiotics and steroids and paxil.  I had a very hard time coming off of the paxil and I was very uncomfortable on it. The mental benefit was not worth the physical detriment.
citalopram,8,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"Alleviation of mild depression, effective progressively after 3 weeks of start. Removal of anxiety.","Slight skin irritation, temporary. Dulling of mental activity, feeling of no concern regarding important subjects. Eventually feeling the drug was inhibiting overall life progress.","20mg daily for 3 months, taken as one pill each evening
10mg daily subsequently for 6 months."
citalopram,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"That I felt able to function.
The dose was perfect for my condition.
Felt more calm and moods much better.","mild headache at the start, and loss of appetite.","citalopram has made it possible for me to feel good whilst coping with depression. My only concern, like with any medication is becoming dependent."
citalopram,1,Ineffective,Moderate Side Effects,I felt that i did not feel any benefits from this drug.,"I felt more anxious than before starting on this medication, these effects lasted about ten days, i began having headaches which lasted about a week. I carried on taking citalopram for six weeks with no benefit, so my doctor increased the dose to 40mg daily. Four weeks later i decided to stop this medication as I felt like a zombie, as though my thoughts were on a go slow. I quit there and then, which i know is not advisable, but I just wanted to get this drug out of my system. The worst withdrawl symptom I had was the strange dreams/nightmares. I will never forget them, they were so vivid and funnily enough i had not had (remembered) any dreams for the previous five years.",Starting dose 20mg daily. Increased to 40mg daily after initial six weeks.
wellbutrin-xl,7,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,"elevation of mood and clarity of thought.  Progress stalled out at 300 mg, but with increase to 450 mg can tell the difference.  I'm able to finally think and plan ahead and chip away at all the clutter I've not been able to deal with which accumulated while depressed.","none at 300 mg.  Possible tinnitus from increase to 450 mg, not evaluated by an audiologist yet though.  Did experience weight loss (7 lbs.) at 450 mg dosage.",Inital treatment included therapy and Lexapro in addition to Wellbutrin XL.  Now only on the Wellbutrin XL.  I see the psychiatrist every 4 months for re-evaluation.
wellbutrin-xl,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Greatly benefitted depression. I started to take this just before my child was born, having had post partum depression with another baby, and I was anticipating my life to be at least as hectic, if not more hectic, when this child was born as when the older child was born. I was very  pleased with the antidepressant effects. I never experienced any depression at all once this baby was born. I did not experience hypomania like I did with sertraline, which was a huge concern of mine. I just did not become depressed when this baby was born.","Wellbutrin can make me feel anxious, which is why I have a prescription for clonazepam whenever I am taking wellbutrin. The worst side effect was the cost. I have no health insurance and wellbutrin xl is very expensive. I did not notice weight loss, as some others have, nor did I ever notice an increase in my libido. I tolerated it very well.","I started to take wellbutrin xl at about six months of pregnancy and continued for approx six months, when the baby was about three months old. I usually took it in the morning, but often times forgot and took it later in the day. None of this seemed to affect how well it worked. Were it not for the fact that it is so expensive and that it can be toxic to the body, I would take it every day.

abilify,6,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,I've only been on it for a week but I've noticed a change already. I am more awake and it seems as though a fog has been lifted. I am thinking more clearly and don't feel so down.,None so far.,My doctor added Abilify to my 60 mg of Cymbalta because I was feeling really fatigued and unable to function.
wellbutrin-sr,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"It greatly helped with my depression which was caused by a divorce after 28 years of marriage. 3 months after my separation my Father died and my Mother became very angry and unresponsive with me.When I started taking this medication I was able to focus better at work and at home I was able to effectively deal with my emotions, I also experienced an increase in my libido. I am still currently taking the generic form of Wellbutrin SR (Bupropion).","I took Wellbetrin XL for a little while, but I didn't like it because I felt like my emotions were on a rollercoaster ride. I went back to the generic form of Wellbutrin SR and I felt better, I would like to try the name brand of Wellbutrin since I have heard that it is actually better than the generic.I don't recall any bad side effects,except a little dry mouth.","I take 1 tablet in the morning an 1 tablet at night everyday. When I am able to afford it I intend to try the brand name of this product to see if it will help with my libido now since I have had a hysterectomy and am experiencing low libido, weight gain, and depression of a different kind than I experienced in the beginning."
zoloft,9,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,"resolved depression within one week. I was told it did not work that fast, but I know it did. It is",None. I have not had any effects from the drug other than stopping the depression.,I take it most days. At times I have stopped taking it for 30-50 days and the depression returns. I believe it is good to occasionally stop the medicine to be sure it is still needed.
wellbutrin,7,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"Medication helped with depression, my irritable bowel syndrome, appetite control, and there were no sexual side effects","dry mouth, difficulty sleeping","I was treated for several years with the above medication, it worked better than anything I had tried. I was able to taper off the medication--NEVER quit abruptly--and have been doing fine. I began running to help with the depression and IBS and, in my opinion, it works very well. I still have times of irritability, but that's normal life, right?"
effexor-xr,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,My symptoms of depression were eased considerably.  I felt more like myself and began to take pleasure in activities. I stopped feeling sad and crying. I was able to concentrate again.  My appetite returned and my sleep patterns normalized.,The drug made me nauseated the first month I took it. The only other significant ongoing side effect I experienced was constipation.,"I began taking Effexor XR when I was severely depressed. I took it once a day for approximately five years.  My symptoms included crying, lack of interest in life, inability to concentrate, loss of appetite, and sleeping more than usuual. I could barely get out of bed and I could not function. Within two weeks of beginning treatment with Effoxor, I began to feel take more of an interest in normal activities and was able to eat and sleep normally."
effexor,7,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"The drug prevented emotional highs and lows.  Specifically helped with crying too much.  Lessened the intense ""caring"".  In some cases, it lessened it too much.",There were strange sensations when 2+ doses were missed. Certain sounds seemed exaggerated.,This was part of a treatment for Adult ADD.  I continued it for depression.
effexor,7,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"In comparison with other antidepression medications I have taken prior to the effexor, It actually began working faster than the others (after about 2 weeks).  Most antidepressants usually take closer to 4 weeks to see improvements. Depression symptoms were significantly reduced.","I experienced moderate constipation as well as excessive night sweating.  Would become completely drenched in sweat during sleep. Also experienced sexual side effects (low libido). The thing I really don't like about effexor is that if I miss a day for some reason, I begin to experience feelings of dizziness within 24 hours.",150 mg daily
remeron,2,Ineffective,Severe Side Effects,No apparent benefits.  Had virtually no effect on my depression and it quickly became intolerable to use.,"Extreme drowsiness, weight gain.",Had virtually no effect on my depression and the side effects were intolerable.  Took it at bedtime but was still quite groggy throughout the day.  Gained about 25lbs before I stopped it.
citalopram,4,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"Some symptoms of depression - crying all the time, dark thoughts - were lessened, although hard to know how much benefit the treatment gave all told or whether I would have come through it anyway as I had in the past.","When started on treatment: vivid images when eyes closed, trembling, anxiety, feeling of detachedness
Throughout treatment: Insomnia and disrupted sleep patterns, some dizziness at times, muscular twitching, fidgeting and spasming, weight loss due mostly to fidgeting all the time
Coming off treatment: what others have termed ""brain shivers"", a sort of brain zing which was very disturbing, crying, feeling like the depression was coming back","20mg once daily for 5 months, weaning self off over 1 month decreasing dosage until 10mg every two days then stopped"
prozac,7,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,The drug seemed to effectively treat the symptoms of depression for a year or so.  After the first year or so the depression seemed to come back now and then - although it did seem to be cyclical.,"Nausea if taken on an empty stomach, shakiness, dry mouth.",There were no other details of the treatment.  I changed to another drug that worked more effectively and have been on that one for several years.
lexapro,8,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"I have clinical depression with aggitation and anger. This medication seemed to take the edge off the anger as well as decrease my depressive symptoms. I started at 10mg, then shortly increased to 20mg, which left me feeling too drugged. It was only after 12+ months of taking 10 mg that it was increased due to increasing depressive symptoms.","Initially the medication made me very drowsy. I began taking it at bedtime, which seemed to eleviate that particular concern.  I think there may have been some weight gain, but I am not certain that it was specifically related to the Lexapro. Also, I did initially have difficult acheiving orgasm, but this side effect seemed to diminish within 6-9 months.","I'm not sure waht you mean here- I started on the medication over 2 years ago at 10 mg a day. The dosage was increased to 20 mg after about 12 months.  The side effects were limited, and mostly not perticularly bothersome."
celexa,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"when the drug actually kicked in, after about 10 days as i recall, it was an amazing experience.I got out of bed and was walking to the bathroom to shower. I was whistling!!!I stopped and thought, hey whats going on here. I realized I felt great, like a heavy weight had been lifted from my shoulders. I felt better than i had felt for a hell of a long time. Never forget it, a fantastic feeling.Truly helped me to cope with the stress of business and relationships.I have recommended it two occasions both had a similar experience to my own.","quite severe night sweats and yawning,dry mouth,ejaculation disorder (not always a bad thing)",not sure what you mean by this. Was in relationship counceling and the psycologist suggested I was depressed as well as stressed. she suggested citalopram. saw my gp who prescribed it. never looked back. I did slide back in to depression a couple of years after first taking the drug but recognised the symptoms and got another script from my doctor with the same positive results.
wellbutrin,6,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,The medication treated the depression without the sexual side-effects that accompanied several other medications for depression.,"Unfortunately, the drug seemed to correlate with an increased severity of a pre-existing condition: tinnitus. The tinnitus which was moderate to begin with became severe and ultimately led me to stop taking the medication. The tinnitus, though still present, is markedly less severe and decreased almost immediately after stopping the medication.","I was prescribed Wellbutrin, was on it for approximately 5 months and gradually stopped over the course of a few days."
prozac,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,Lessening of suicidal ideation and an increased ability to complete daily life tasks.,There was a decreased ability to have orgasms and a general numbing not quite stupor in which I existed. There was also a major decrese in appetite.,"This drug resulted in an unanticipated weightloss of over 20lbs - I went from 128 to 108 lbs. The weight loss decresed the incidences of bulimia. The drug was effective in that I no longer felt depressed per se, but then I didn't feel much of anything. Any combination with alcohol should be avioded - majorly increases its effects!"
remeron,3,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,Hardly any except I felt so physically tired that I couldn't even feel depressed.,"I was so exhausted that I could hardly get out of bed and get to work. At work, I just wanted to put my head down and go to sleep. As soon as I got home around 6pm, I had to go to bed. It was ridiculous.","I just started treatment for severe depression. I sleep okay, but have nightmares all night, which is why my doctor recommended Remeron. I am going to ask for a change in this because even though it has only been a few days, I am barely functional."
prozac,6,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"Less depressed, I could consintrate on daily life better. I was happier, less anxious, stopped worrying so much.","I felt manic at times, surreal. I was thirsty a lot, and forgot to eat.","I was suppose to take 20mg daily for treatment of depression, it helped my depression but i often felt manic and 'not myself'"
citalopram,7,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,I feel that the citalopram helps keep me calm. I no longer have mood swings as often. No longer feel the need to just stay at home bymyself. No longer want to leave work because of depressed moods.,First 2 days wicked nasea. I do sweat more than usual. Trouble sleeping at times.,I started taking 20mg pills for a few months. I noticed that it would feel as though it was wearing off by 7pm or so. My doctor prescribed me up to 30mg for a week and then to 40mg for the rest of the month. Things seem better than on the 20mg. However I still get depressed at times and nothing seems to ever go right. Perhaps therapy will help which my doctor mentioned. Going to continue on the 40mg for a few more months and see if it helps if not I will make another apt at the doctor and see what she thinks weather we want to try and up the dose or try something different.
zoloft,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Highly motivated vs my previous state of, ""why do I get up in the morning""? Nothing upset me- even something that would put down a generally happy person.","Harder to climax, although I didn't necessarily lose interest in sex drive.",Went off of it once I felt better- I have been off of it for about 6 months and feel good still.
paxil,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,I believe that I suffered from depression my whole life.  I feel like the first years of my life would have been very different if I had some treatment for my feelings.  My whole family would agree that I am much much happier and have a feeling of peace in my life.,I am not sure if it is only the drug but I have almost no sexual feelings. Could just be my age...who knows.,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""treatment details"" but I saw a psycotherapist for several months and she prescribed the paxil and ok'd the paroxetine.  I share my treatment with anyone because I think that depression is not the best descriptive word for what was troubeling me.  Thanks for your work!"
zoloft,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,Patient experienced no treatment benefits.,"The major side effect was persistent thoughts of suicide - always by hanging. These thoughts developed after about three weeks of treatment and became more persistent as time went on. Patient stopped taking the medication after two months subsequently informing attending physician, who initially did not believe that medication could provoke that side effect in someone 50 years of age.",Treatment details are as described above.
wellbutrin,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"Wellbutrin and Prozac stabilized my moods and kept me from slipping into depression. There really wasn't anything more to it, but I gather I have to write 50 words, so here they are.",None.,I'm not sure I understand the question. This was pretty simple - I had a tendency to slip into deep depressions without medication. The drugs prevented that without side effects.
lexapro,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"The benefits were that once I started taking it, I became less emotional when I got upset.  I could handle the small things better than before, which used to set me off.  It evened out my moods so that I was less tempermental.","If I missed taking a dose, I would feel a bit lightheaded, dizzy or have a headache.  Too many missed doses lead to a really irritable mood.","After a break-up, I was very depressed and upset all the time.  I began taking a dose of 20mg and within a few days, noticed a difference.  I had fewer dramatic mood swings, and was able to handle the everyday things that got me upset in a more reasonable manner.  I did not feel like crying as frequently as before the medication, and I feel it helps me keep a pretty even temper.  I continue to take this medication because I have been told I have a natural chemical imbalance, and this keeps me from being overly emotional when it is unnecessary.  Overall, I feel I benefit from taking it, and unless I miss a dose, I have no side effects."
prozac,1,Moderately Effective,Severe Side Effects,"There really weren't any - I didn't feel any better as the stressors in my life were still there.  I did not feel any relief from the depression, as a matter of fact, I felt worse.",I couldn't sleep at night and would fall asleep during the day.  It sometimes made me agitated too.,"I really wasn't comfortable with taking Prozac in the first place - I had a crappy HMO doctor who thought giving me a pill would solve my problem.  I really just needed a change in my life (job, living in DC) to reverse my depression.  In other words, I think my depression was situational, not a chemical imbalance.  I know that these do work for many people, but I think it's imperative that a person know WHY they are depressed before they hit the pharmacy."
prozac,8,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"relief of depression, ""floor"" under worst moods, increased confidence, less sadness. Allowed patient to function normally in work and social situations","Loss of libido, occasional fatigue. Jittery feeling when dosage was temporarily increased to 40mg","Was originally prescribed medication by psychiatrist, continued prescription from GP after cessation of psychiatric treatment"
paxil,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,there was none.,"he didnt get out of bed for three days,couldnt get him to eat (he only weighed 120 lbs),had to forse him to drink water, became even more depresses very suasidal,out of it,  and lethargic. We had to take him to hospital(They were not helpful at all) Would only help if he had made a suaside attempt.","Took him to doctor a few times for deppression. Doctor wrote a perscription. He was just a M.D., did not get a syc eval."
wellbutrin,3,Ineffective,Moderate Side Effects,Did not take it long enough for any noticeable benefit.,"My hair started falling out after the first week. During  week two, I saw my doctor and told her about this. She said it was not a known side effect. Internet research assured me the hair loss was not coincidental; others had the same reaction. I quit taking it a few days later.","300mg Wellbutrin daily.

My hair started falling out after the first week. During  week two, I saw my doctor and told her about this. She said it was not a known side effect. Internet research assured me the hair loss was not coincidental; others had the same reaction. I quit taking it a few days later."
zoloft,5,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,i believe the medication did assist with depression. By the end of the six month most symptons of depression were gone,when I was coming off the medication it was recommeded to do slowly by reducing the medication dosage gradually which i did. Side effects while doing this were diziness almost constantly,"not sure what you are wanting, but one pill everyday"
paxil,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,solved my depression and helped me have an overall better outlook on life.,"Pleasant vivid dreams, night sweats, intermentrual bleeding,numbed other emotions, minor weight gain, unable to fall asleep (but after about 4 months, this didn't happen)","I take 20 mg once a day first thing in the morning, and it no longer keeps me awake late into the night.   I overall would recommend this drug to others.  I take the generic."
lexapro,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,"The first few days I felt ""happier""","at the 3 week mark, I started having SEVERE anxiety attacks that were constant. I was in a constant state of worry & I couldn't get warm,couldn't sleep,couldn't eat,NOTHING..I quit taking it & went through withdrawls even though the doctor said I wasn't on it long enough to go through withdrawls. It's been about 4 weeks & I am STILL not all the way back to where I was before taking this ""devil pill""",It was horrible..just read above
wellbutrin-sr,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"I began to notice the positive benefits within a few weeks.  My mood brightened, I stopped feeling grief and self-loathing, began to remember what I liked to do. I also had increased ability to concentrate, increased energy, increased sex drive.   I was no longer depressed.  I stopped taking the medication after a couple of years, and the symptoms of depression did not return.","I actually felt pretty upset during the first couple of weeks - shaky, a little manic and sensitive.  That did go away, though.  I also had occasional insomnia throughout.","I met with my physician four weeks after I began taking the medication, then 3 months later, then every six months. I did not attend talk therapy or receive any other treatment."
cymbalta,8,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"It itnitially helped a great deal. The first 2 days I slept and I felt really good for a change. My aches and pains seemed to vanish. I had energy and felt motivated. My ""quick to aggravate"" temperment diminished as well.","The first 2 days on it I slept. Then by the fourth to fifth month, I started to experience heart palpitations at an increasing rate daily. I was weaned off and restarted 6 or so months later and once again, by the 4-5 month range, the palpitations started to increase again. During the first round, I had a dimished appetite and lost 15 lbs. During the second round, it didn't seem to affect my appetite either way.",I was started on 30 mg po qd for 2 weeks then increased to 60 mg po qd.
lexapro,8,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"helped anxiety & black moods, headaches.  Made my life a happier place to be in, especially for my family.  Have had great results with lexapro with only minimal side effects such as a small weight gain.","Would not recommend going off lexapro cold turkey as the effects of doing this are pretty horrible such as head spins, highly recommend slowly weaning yourself off it.  Have had a slight weight gain due to slowing me down considerably.","Doctor prescribed lexapro when I had seen him about black moods & depression which is something I have had on and off since I was very young.   Depression was starting to effect my family life so felt I needed to see a doctor, he prescribed me lexapro as it helps with depression & anxiety.  I was prescribed 10mg and take one tablet daily.  I visit the doctor regularly to update progress on lexapro"
paxil,7,Considerably Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,Significantly decreased depression and anxiety. More effective than Lexapro which was also taken prior by patient. Definitely a more effective product.,None which was an improvement from Lexapro which caused insomnia and fatigue. Did not experience any significant side effects.,Taken daily at night before bedtime. Also exercised daily and increased activity which contributed to success.

Pt continues on the regimen today (has been for years 5+)
prozac,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Having had severe TPM symptoms for many years, I asked my doctor for Fluoxetine. The benefits were a total feeling of ""well-being"". Without the extreme ""high"" feeling of anfetamines (taken before as part of a supervised diet regimen). High decrease on anxiety. Appetite more controled. Clearness of my thoughts. Decrease on crisis of depression (specially during the days previous to my periods). More ""energy"" during the day to the daily things.. decrease on obsessive compulsive (mild) disorder","The side effects with the intake of Fluoxetine for me included mild insomnia, headaches (specially in the beginning of the treatment). Loss of appetite. Mild change in the sense of taste. Little bit of nausea after a big meal. Or something very different from the usual food. Change in mood (varieting a lot specially in the beginning of treatment).",Fluoxetine 20mg. Taken once daily (variation: twice daily during week previous to period). For a period of 6 months (at least 3 months; possibly to be discontinued if great increase was noticed). Not to be taken with any other drug before consulting a doctor.

lexapro,6,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,"less irritability, slept better. Was less hungry.","mild mania, manifested by spending more money. I felt less inhibition in my spending and bought more products than I had in the past.","Was put on paxil which was quite effective but had the side effect of wt gain. Switched to lexapro. Wt gain more easily controlled, but wasn't as effective as paxil for depression. Now I'm on nothing and I'm doing well."
lexapro,6,Marginally Effective,No Side Effects,"The treatment benefits were marginal at best.  Mood neither improved nor deteriorated, and anxiety was never significantly alleviated.  Unsurprisingly, recent research suggests that SSRIs are only effective in the most severe of cases.","On the plus side, I experienced no major side effects.  The possible effects can range from nausea to sexual dysfunction, but none were a problem.  However, it is possible to feel a sort of withdrawal.","The pills are administered once a day, daily, for as long as you think it's worth taking them.  The prescribing physician recommended taking Lexapro for at least six months to get the full benefit of its normalizing effects."
effexor,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"I did not experience the ""brain-fog"" that I did with Celexa. I felt great after the first couple of days - relieved the depression immensely.","I was one of the few who experienced severe constipation from taking Effexor. Thankfully, this side-effect abated after two weeks. I've also noticed that just one of my eyes appears to have decreased in visual accuity - from 20/20 to maybe 20/30-40.","After using Celexa for 7 years, it decreased in its helpfulness. Celexa always made me feel like I was in a fog as well - hated the stuff. Immediately after taking Effexor, I felt the fog lift and I can't begin to tell you how relieved I am,  or how greatly that improveed the quality of my life. I still have moments where I feel a little anxious, but as a whole, the depression is being taken care of. When I noticed a decrease in visual accuity in my right eye, I stopped taking the drug. My eyesight seemed to return to normal. Oddly, my left eye is fine, but it was always extraordinarily good."
lexapro,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Lessened anxiety,brought about more attention","drowsiness,lethargy,lack of deep emotions",take one pill daily
wellbutrin-xl,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,complete improvement in flat sad affect.  Felt depression completely lift by the end of four weeks.,initially insomnia that went away after the first few weeks.  I also lost about 12 pounds without trying.  I felt a little jittery in the beginning but this subsided as well.,My doctor added wellbutrin to my existing zoloft for treatment of my depression.  By adding this my zoloft side effects went away and my depression lifted.
wellbutrin,5,Moderately Effective,No Side Effects,"I have a long history in taking anti-depressant drugs.  It started in high school with prozac and desipramine, neither of which I have anything positive to report.  In college, after a dangerous stint without treatment, it resumed with luvox, and  later it was effexor.  Finally, after the scariest bout of all, leading to a stay in the hospital, they put me on wellbutrin.  Combined with rigorous therapy, dbt (dialectical behavioral therapy) groups, and much personal work, I got my head above water.  I was able to work, eat well and exercise regularly, but many of the symptoms were still there.  I thought that was the extent of what an anti-depressant could do for me, the rest of the work was up to me and maybe in about 20 years I might be able to feel happiness.  Since then I went off wellbutrin during a cross-country move, was part of a study for treatment resistant depression where it was recommended I try cymbalta.  I feel the cymbalta has actually influenced my negative thinking and given me more energy.  So now I know that an anti-depressant can potentially create better results than just keeping ones head above water.","None of the previous meds I mentioned, however did a damn thing but cause me to shake, be continuously thirsty and not be able to achieve orgasm.  The wellbutrin was great in that it didn't cause any sexual side effects.  That was a relief.  The ability to reach orgasm seems as if it should me a basic right for every human being, and the emptiness that replaces the disappearance of the bodies biological ability to feel good, just doesn't seem right.  I was very adament in telling my psychiatrist that I didn't want anything that caused sexual side effects, which most anti-depressants do.  The cymbalta causes the ""emptiness""  but honestly, the improvement it has made in my mood and productivity make it worth it for now.  Plus, I'm not in a meaningfully intimate relationship at the moment.  It seems to only cause and inability to reach inner orgasm however.  Clitoral orgasm is still possible with vibrator and not a human being.   Recently they have added a dose of wellbutrin to my regimen as an attempt to counteract the sexual side effect caused by the cymbalta.  I do not yet know if this is working (Like I said, I have no boyfriend so I don't even know why I'm bothering.  Really I did it to see if the addition of wellbutrin would make me feel even better.  I haven't felt much difference.","Once a month I see a psychiatrist, although I am ""in between"" doctors right now because my previous one left as they always seem to do.  I have been without a therapist for a while now, wanting to take a break from the time and monetary commitment  that therapy demands.  I am  beginning to think that now is a good time to go back to it.  I consider the jogging, yoga, healthy eating and vitamins I take to be a part of my treatment."
wellbutrin-xl,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Aided in decreasing symptoms of depression, and also reduced craving for cigarettes as a bonus.  Noticeably less lethargy.","Side effects were generally positive, including help with smoking cessation as well as increased libido, which had decreased on Lexapro.","In conjunction with taking Lexapro for anxiety, Wellbutrin XL was taken (150 mg/day) to reduce depression and balance the side effects of Lexapro, including lethargy, weight gain and sexual dysfunction.  Lexapro was taken in evening, Wellbutrin XL in the morning."
prozac,2,Ineffective,No Side Effects,None,None,"Took for several months, told my doctor it was NOT making a difference so she doubled the dose to 40 mg. I couldn't stand the thought of putting more chemicals in my body if they weren't doing anything so I never filled the doubled prescription and focused on counseling, which made a difference."
citalopram,7,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,I feel better about myself and less anxious and depressed.,I have taken it for almost two weeks now and I feel really tired and increased yawning. I have taken it during the day and at night which in the morning  I feel tired still.,I take it once a day at 20mg per pill. I do better on it now then I do without it. So I will keep my fingers crossd and hope the sleepness goes away.
prozac,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Before taking Prozac I had no energy or joy - I could barely lift my head off the pillow in the morning. I just wanted to stay in bed. When I first started taking it, I could feel it physically - I felt a little ""giddy"" and my eyes felt/looked glazed. But over time, those feelings went away and I just felt normal. I no longer felt like I was on a drug - I just felt good. I could get up in the morning and looked forward to each day.","I had very vivid dreams/nightmares the entire time I took it. Eight years later, I can still remember many of them and the way they made me feel. I gained weight (from 115lbs to 130lbs).",I began by taking 5mg tablets one time a day for one week. The next week I increased to 10mg tablets on time/day. I took Prozac for one year. When I stopped taking it I reduced the dosage to 5mg tablets one time a day for about 2 weeks. I did not have any ill effects when I quit taking it.
effexor,6,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,depression reduced - I had taken it at a lower dosage at first - but his had no effect - at all - so psychiatrist had to prescribe a higher dosage than the family doctors are allowed...the effect was amazing - I suddenly felt a 100% better after  a week or so - I had been on the lower dosage for months with no effect.,"I felt nauseous. Gradually I became acclimatised the effects- so after the initial boost I felt normal again - like I could engage with life. After a while (6-months) I felt like I was experiencing a distance because of the drugs, instead of feeling engaged in life like I had felt initially, I felt like I was veiled from it.","I was prescribed increasing doses by my family doctor until he had reached the maximum (150) he could prescribe. I tried to commit suicide, I was referred to a psychiatrist who doubled the dose. After seeing the psychiatrist twice over 2 months. I did not have to see her again. And my family doctor could continue to prescribe at this higher dose."
effexor,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Signifigantly reduced depression, social anxiety. Mild side effects.","Forgetfullness, some manifestation of laissez-faire attitude (not caring as much about work issues, but in some ways this is a good thing! As long as you don't end up slacking off too much), harder to reach orgasm (but much better than Paxil or Prozac in this matter).","I've been on Effexor for about 7 years, and love it. It doesn't make you sleepy or passive. It doesn't kill your sex drive, though it is reduced a bit, and it's still harder to reach orgasm. Best part about this med is that it doesn't make you sleepy or foggy. 

You may have to increase dosage after a couple of years. It started to poop out on me at about year 3, and since then I've been climbing with the dosage. 

I've tried many anti-depressants, and this is the gold standard for me. Paxil robbed me of many years...no ambition, no focus, very sloppy housekeeping. Effexor is much better."
cymbalta,4,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"The benifit of taking the drug was to decrease the symptoms of depression and anxiety. In addition, the drug did not suppress the libido on the opposite it increase the sexual desire.",Side effects were many.  THEre was a decrease in energy levels and dizzines.  There was weight gain. At the end of the 30 days period the feelings of depression were still an issue,"The treatment consisted of taking 30mg every morning for thirty days.  Also, started an exercise program to increase the endorphins levels in the brain.  The doctor suggested fifteen minutes of sunshine a day. After the thirty days period the follow up consisted of answering questions about the positive and negative  effects of the drug. After reviewing the answers it was determined that I needed to be on a higher dosage because the symptoms of depression were still an issue.  The increase in dosage was from 30mg to 60mg and still at the end of thirty days there was mo change in the symptoms.  Finally I had to switch to another medication which so far it has worked fine."
prozac,9,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,Reduced depression and feelings of hopelessness within 3 weeks. I like being able to increase dosage when things get a little rough and then back off to the original dosage when things settle down.,"Extreme sleepiness, feeling ""out of it"".  It was really hard to work and be on this medication.  I wanted to give it up as I literally could not stay awake but I made it though the first 6 weeks and things were better after that.  I have been on it for 10 years now and do not notice any side effects.","Took pill once a day and visited therapist once a month.  After awile, I didn't go to the therapist anymore and I was extremely even with just the medication."

sarafem,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"I have taken this drug off and on for the past 13 years. I have always had good results with it, but I wanted to go off it to have children. Then, after my last child, I tried to make it without medication, but I realized I couldn't. I am very careful about the medications I take and I don't like being stuck on anything. However, I realized that I needed help and my children needed a happy Mommy. I went back on Prozac (the generic form) 2 months ago and now feel better than I have in years. I can cope with the daily stresses of life without losing my temper, or my mind. I can face the responsibilities of each day without fear, hopelessness, or doubt. I can laugh and enjoy my children. I am truly a new person. I am regretting not going back on this medication sooner.","Honestly, the only side effect I have had is that it is harder to have an orgasm. I can still have them, but it just takes longer. I don't really feel ""in the mood"" as much, but that is a very small detriment compared to what I was experiencing before. I have had no other side effects whatsoever. I do not even feel ""mediciney"" or out of it at all and no stomach problems, either.","I am planning on seeing my doctor every 6 months and have my blood checked once a year to check my liver, etc., but so far am doing great. I do see a counselor every 2 weeks, which is invaluable to me."
sarafem,8,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"This drug improved my mood greatly. I can take more stress at work, in my romantic life, and family situations where as before, I would crawl under a rock and cry. A lot of people say that they don't feel much on this drug, but I think it was low enough to where I could have moderate lows and elevated highs. It helped me control my impulsive behavior with eating.","I had headaches if I didn't take it with enough food in my stomach. I also have insomnia, however, if you cut your intake of caffeine, it shouldn't be too severe.","I took this at noon. It's a strange feeling on this drug because later in the day, I feel a bit strange. Either way, I know what people mean when they say that they feel a lot of indifference come over them at times they should be feeling overwhelming emotions. This drug helps me cope and sometimes I feel like I don't need it anymore, but I go right back on it when I feel the blues creeping up on me again."
effexor-xr,7,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,"Made a huge difference in my depression (post natal) at first. Had tried Zoloft after my previous pregnancy, which seemed to stop working. Cycled through a number of other drugs (8 within 9 months) and ended up sticking with EffexorXR as it seemed the one with the least side-effects initially.","Weight gain, difficulty losing weight, blurry vision, general 'blah' moods. 
Attempted to taper off & managed to only go from 225 to 150mg for a week before MAJOR side effects kicked in: headaches, brain 'zaps', aggression, agitation, extreme mood swings and hives.

effexor-xr,8,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"Helped ease depressed mood, less mood swings. Better overall sense of well being. I was not as emotional and life felt more managable. I didnt even notice its effects while on it. I have tried other antidepressants that made me feel disconnected and my mind was cloudy, also experienced weight gain. Effexor did not make me feel like I was on anything, it just worked in the background. I only noticed it effects once I quit, my emotions were stronger and all my senses seemed intensified.","Bad withdrawels upon quiting medication. Sexual side effects, My senses seemed dulled.","Took 75 mgs once daily for about three months, then wheened myself of it. Very difficult to do, had withdrawels that included nausua, crying, dizzyness, brain felt like it was short circuiting in a way. I had to lay in bed when I didnt take it for 2 days."

At 300 mg the improvement showed more dramatic results

After treatment: remarkably fewer periods of light depression, able to work."
effexor,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,There were absolutely NO treatment benefits. I felt worse while on this drug than before I started taking it.,"I felt like I had consumed 12,000 cups of coffee. I was anxious, nervous, jittery and irritable. I could not sit still.","I was supposed to start at this dose and then go up to a higher dose after a few weeks. I completely took myself off of this drug since it was not helping me and there was no way I was going to increase my dosage. My doctor never even followed up with me after prescribing this medication...tsk, tsk!!"

Once off the Prozac my depression was worsen made me realise that the treatment was working but that I had not realised this.I restarted my treatment shortly after and felt much better. Although I felt better I realised that Prozac by itself was not the answer and I had to address other areas in my life.,There was no negative side effects.,Within the first eight months I did not notice any benefits and decided to stop the treatments.

Although I felt better I realised that Prozac by itself was not the answer and I had to address other areas in my life.
effexor,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"The effexor worked the first day I took it.  For some time previously, I had felt ""paralyzed,"" or too depressed to get much done.  The day I began taking it, I noticed a difference in that I felt more able to get out of the house, and able to cope with the difficulties of mothering 6 children full-time. As I said, it worked the first day, but continued to work better and better over the next 3 weeks until I worked up to my eventual dose (I started at 37 mg. and worked my way up to 300 mg.).","The only side effect I noticed was that if, for some reason, I forgot to take the effexor in the morning, by the evening I felt sort of dizzy in a really weird way.","I'm not clear on what is wanted in this section.  I will do my best, and if you wish to email me with a request for specific info, I will be happy to help.  I was seeing a psychiatrist 9 years ago who thought Effexor was worth a try.  I had been on Prozac a few yrs previous, and although it worked really well, after taking it for two years I developed the side effect of experiencing arthritic pain in my hands.  That was the reason I discontinued the use of Prozac. After being off the Prozac or any other meds for a year or two, I could feel myself sliding back into the black hole of depression and severe anxiety.  I found a doctor (psychiatrist)and he put me on Effexor.  It was a miracle.  I was soooo happy to find something that worked so well, and on the first try. (Several years before, I had gone through what my family refers to as the ""year of hell,"" when I first began the journey of searching for an anti-depressant that would work AND not have side effects that kept me from functioning normally.) My treatment consisted of: Taking the 300 mg of effexor, and monthly visits to my psychiatrist to determine how well my effexor was working and to discuss other treatment options. Although I could notice a marked difference in my mood, I still felt that I wasn't nearly as healthy mentally as I needed to be.  I would still have days when I felt ""paralyzed"" and very anxious.  When I discussed the problem with my psych., he suggested that I add Luvox, another anti-depressant, to my regimen.  That helped as well, although there were two unpleasant side effects: 1) loss of sex drive and difficulty achieving orgasm, and 2) night sweats.  My doc prescribed 1 mg of hytrin for the night sweats; it worked, and he recommended 60 mg. ginko biloba daily for the loss of sex drive.  It may have helped a little, but I was never quite sure. One other thing I found beneficial for my anxiety was 10 mg. dexadrine.  It seemed contradictory to me that a stimulant would calm me down, but the very first day I took it, I felt calm for the first time in my life. Up until then I didn't realize how severe my anxiety was, because I had never known what it was like to be without it. But that very first day I took it, I felt a calmness come over me that was such a relief.  Always before, I had a feeling inside that I can only explain as the feeling one would get if one was late for an important meeting with one's boss.  Sort of like, ""I'm late! Gotta hurry! oh, no!""  That was a feeling that I had always had, and it had nothing to do with what my situation was-- late or early, it made no difference.  For the first two weeks I took the Dexadrine, I didn't pull my hair (trichotillomania)at all, nor did I even realize I wasn't pulling, as I didn't even think about it.  Unfortunately, I did go back to pulling after that. The 2 side effects I experienced with the dex. is that 1) it made me drowsy for about the first hour after I took it, and 2) it made me feel like I lost my spontaneity.  I got a lot more done, and I didn't feel so panicked, but I wasn't as much fun.  For that reason, I stopped taking it regularly and took it maybe only half of the time.  After maybe a year or two I quit taking it altogether and when I went back on it last year after having been off of it for about 5 years, it no longer worked as it had before.  It made me feel jittery as though I'd had way too much coffee.  It just made the anxiety worse.

I'm not sure if I was supposed to tell about more than one medication for this survey. However, these four meds I've mentioned were all sort of intertwined, so it seemed appropriate for me to do so. I have taken a myriad of other anti-depressants in my quest to find one that would work, and I would be willing to share my experiences with those other meds as well. Just let me know if you want mori info."
effexor-xr,3,Marginally Effective,Severe Side Effects,some decreased depression but not as well as with wellbutrin,"constipation, dizziness and elevated bp",had to stop the mediccine and go back to taking wellbutrin 300mg xl.  the side effect of going off of the effexor included a lot of dizziness

It goes after taking my normal dose within about 3 to 4 hours","I was clinically depressed about 8 years ago ,under alot of work based stress and looking after a young famiy,Eventually saw my GP who prescribed Venlafaxine &%mg which worked well. Some time later my mood dipped..I cant recall the details and the dose was increased . I have been unable to come off it . I tried Fluoxetine at one point but this was not nearly as eefective . I am waiting till I retire to withdraw because I cant afford to take time off work ..not financially,just becaue of my commitments"
wellbutrin,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"The drug worked on reducing/eliminating my situational feelings of depression.  Initially, it increased my energy and focus, and stopped the feelings of sadness.  It did not make me feel like a ""zombie"" and I felt connected to my emotions and the people around me, which I had heard was a side effect of other anti-depressants.","At first I had crazy dreams, whch wasn't so bad.  I did not have any trouble falling asleep.  I had very high energy for the first 2 weeks, then it tapered off back to normal.  I wish the energy had remained.  I did not lose any weight, which I was hoping for...but I did not gain any either, so that was positive.","I started on 150 mg for 2 weeks on the brand name drug once a day.  It seemed like as soon as I was switched to the generic 300mg, the energy and focus benefits stopped.  There is no way to know if it was the switch to generic or just my body getting used to the drug, but it was dissapointing.  I really enjoyed the energy.  I weaned myself off after 1 year because I didn't need it anymore.  I did not have any significant withdrawal symptoms.  Overall it was a positive experience, although I was glad to not need it anymore."

This combination of treatments worked  well for me, and now I don't have to take the medication and only require counselling sessions occasionally."
zoloft,9,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"When the antidepressant finally kicked in (after about two weeks), I finally felt ""normal.""  It made me realize how down I was.  I've heard other people say the same thing about feeling ""normal.""  I would still get down but it wouldn't last for days.  I could get through it like a healthy-minded person.  It was such a relief from what I had been feeling.  I told myself that I would take it forever if I had to......anything to not feel what I had been feeling for years:  depressed that I'm not good enough.","In the past few years I've tried to get off of it by reducing my dose.  I cut my pills in half (to 50 mg) and after a few weeks went through a depression that REALLY sucked.  But I got through it.  When I tried to take it down to 25 mg, I got really depressed again and it wouldn't go away.  I went back up to 50mg and am still there.","When I try again to cut back on the dose, I think I'll go to a psychiatrist while doing it.  Regular physicians who refill my prescription don't know me and don't know how to offer advice about doing this.

Sometimes I've forgotten a day or have run out of a prescription and didn't get it refilled for a few days.  I got a bit light headed.  Definitely not something you can quit cold turkey."
lamictal,7,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,"I've been on meds for depression/anxiety for over 20 years and have tried many medications and combinations. Nothing has ever effectively controlled my depression but Lamictal seems to have stabilized my condition at a tolerable level. I am more mentally ""resilient"".....I don't stay down too long; I'm able to bounce back quickly from a depressive state. I'm also taking Mirtazapine (30mg; 2 a day). Maybe it's the combination that helps. I was recently taking Pristiq and Mirtazapine and was terribly depressed. I quit taking the Pristiq and began Lamictal and had and a very quick improvement.","Lamictal seems to have increased my sex drive. I'm constantly ""horny"" and masturbate alot. The crazy thing is that Lamictal also seems to cause anorgasmia.....difficulty in achieving orgasm. Most of the time I get 99.9% of the way towards feeling like I'm going to climax but don't. So this med has increased my sex drive but doesn't let me fully enjoy the ""benefits"". Anyone have any suggestions in dealing with anorgasmia?",I take one 150MG tablet each morning.

Minimal side effects and only lasted a few days. I couldn't tolerate any other anti-D's that I tried because of side effects.","Minimal but after 3 days I felt nauseas, queezy, fatigued and a bit 'out of it' and numb/detached.
The nausea only lasted a week but the fatigue hung around for a while. Now it's lifting thankfully.
No weight changes at all.","I was skeptical that depression even existed so delayed my psych's advice in taking it for a year.
 Got to the point I felt so bad I admitted I had a problem and began a small dose of 1/4 tablet once a day. 
That's all I need for now too. I feel completely different from how I did 3 months ago - I have a personality again! The low days aren't so low and don't paralyze me anymore.
My appetite is normal again after having none for months. The only weight I put on is what I lost and that's because I'm feeling better and have my appetite back. Still underweight but I'm on the way to being healthy again.
I feel more alive and positive. I don't feel so withdrawn, guilty and ashamed for no reason. It's not a miracle pill and you have to do the work to get there but Lexapro is helping me to 'get there'. I'll take it for as long as I need to. Find a good Dr and PLEASE listen to them and take it if you need to. Don't live in misery because of the stigma society sometimes puts on mental health issues.

Since starting to take wellbutrin my sex drive returned, my ambition and motivation returned.  On my last medication I was going to sleep at 8 p.m and sleeping until morning then requiring a nap in the afternoon and now I sleep 7-8 hrs a night and have enough energy to get through most of my days.

Over all I feel I am managing my depression better than I have at any time in the past.","Side effects in the beginning were a bit of anxiety that eventually past but recently I have been having trouble concentrating, my memory has been poor.

The patient also noted that the desire to consume sweets or carbohydrates was markedly reduced during treatment.","Treatment was easy to administer, being only once a day, and could be altered easily (am or pm).  There were no cardiovascular side effects, no dizziness, blurred vision, or nausea associated with treatment with 10 mg. paroxetine.

I started at a 20 mg pill once daily. I notice approx. 1 yr. later I was still SLIGHTLY depressed, so my Dr. prescribed I move up to 30 mg. I felt great.  In the fall, I noticed 'blue'. (S.A.D.  ?) So my Dr. again prescribed that I move up to 40 mg throughout the winter months to see if that helps with seasonal affective disorder, & that I can start to ween myself back down to 30mg shortly before spring. The only side effect I've noticed so far, has been some mild sweating durting the night that started when I started taking the 40mg.

I thought it might be hormaonal, but after taking away the drug , the symptoms alleviated.","I now feel that I have suffered fibromyalgia for a long time, and part of the reason I was depressd was I found it hard to deal with the pain i was feeling at the time, I had two very young children , and was not diagnosed with a condition . If I had understood my condition better, I may have managed the fibromyalgia better. I was pushing my body too hard, as I felt frustrated t not managing everything better, and the cycle of depression continued. I have come off the venlafaxine, and the symptoms of pain, particularly in the morning have returned, but I can manage them better, knowing it is not symptomatic of a seriously damaging condition, and that it is 'normal' for me. I pace myself better, and no longer have the demands of very young children , so can do that easier. I like being 'drug' free, although I do supplement with fish oils and 5 HTP"

prozac,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"I have taken this drug off and on for 20 years. It is so effective for my depression that I start feeling like I'm ""cured"" and don't need to take it any more. I have found that when I stop taking it, I'll be fine for a few days or weeks, and then I start feeling symptoms of depression again. For the last 3 years, I have taken it regularly and am not planning on stopping. It doesn't make me feel happy every day, because that's not its purpose, however it does keep me from entering a depressive state.","I have not felt any side effects. I know other people feel loss of libido, but I did not suffer this pre-menopause. I have lost some libido since menopause, which is what I attribute it to.","I take 20 mg every morning with my vitamins. For 2 years I took 40 mg every other day, however I haven't felt the need to do this anymore."
prozac,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"this anti-depressant has basically saved my life.  i have suffered with severe depression and anxiety since childhood.  whether these problems were caused by 'nature or nurture' can be difficult to ascertain, but in my particular case, i believe it was both.  while i was a victim of severe sexual, physical and verbal abuse from a very young age through my teen years, i also seem to have been born with an unusually 'sensitive' disposition, and can get very emotionally and mentally disturbed at times with very little provocation.  everyone who knows me well considers me a very emotional person.  at any rate, it has been the prozac that has helped me in dealing with the stresses of even everyday life.  i first started feeling suicidal in adolescence, and unfortunately, this is still a constant problem.  the prozac, i am convinced, has helped me keep these feelings in check, and although i was just hospitalized for my depression late last year, i am still alive and kicking.  i completely believe that it is the prozac that has saved my life.  before the advent of these types of antidepressants, all that was available were the tricyclics.  those never worked for me the way the ssri's have.  although they did achieve in putting me into a stupor-like condition, they never seemed to alleviate my depression.  the prozac does.  while it doesn't rid me of the problem completely, it has been absolutely invaluable to me, and i believe it is the main reason i am alive to write these words to you today.  i am fortunate in that i have never had a single side effect from the prozac.  actually, there has been a complete loss of libido, which could be a major problem for alot of people;  for me, however, this is not a problem, because i am celibate, and have been for 20 years.  trust me, i had enough sex in my younger years to last me for the rest of my life.  i feel i should mention that i have known many people who take prozac and who have not had any sexual problems at all.","initial dosage was 20 mgs. each morning.  this dosage was sufficient for about 5 years, at which point it was raised to 40 mgs. each day.  ultimately, the dosage was raised again approximately 2-3 years after the first increase to my current dosage of 60 mgs. each day.  this is apparently the maximum dosage.  only side effect was loss of libido.","basically you need to see a psychiatrist as often as your condition requires.  i also recommend concurrent visits with some type of therapist or counselor, as this will increase the benefits you receive by taking the medication."

wellbutrin,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,I didn't feel that there were any benefits. I initially started taking Wellbutrin because it was tauted as having little to no sexual side effects. I really was highly disappointed in the overall experience of this drug. I immediately switched back to Effexor.,"After a couple of days of taking the drug, I started experiencing severe flash anger. The smallest nuisance would set me off. I remember actually throwing something across my dining room. It was awful. At that point I decided to no longer take the drug.","I am not certain what I should describe here. The treatment details were that I was prescribed a medication after having asked for it due to its advertised benefits and I never have been so disappointed in a medicine until this one. I am not certain if other people have had similar experiences or not, but it wasn't pleasant."
prozac,8,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,"I felt better mood, optimism towards life in general, greater control of portion sizes. My recovery from anorexia was not easy, so I had a few months of moderate bulimia. It was then that my dosage grew bigger: 3 pills of 20 mg per day, though some days I would have 4 pills.",don't recall,"it takes very long, and requires a very large amount of patience."

I finally knew what it was like to be ""normal"".",I did not experience side effects,"I had taken other anti-depressants with no benefit and negative side effects.  I also had done various talk therapies.  When the dose of Effexor XR got high enough, I felt for the first time what it was like to be ""normal"" - happy, sad, etc. without the overbearing feeling of depression.  When I had to go off the Effexor XR due to cost, the depression recurred.  This drug literally changed my life.  However, when I talk to other people who were not helped by it, they frequently are on a very low dose.  I am glad that I found a doctor willing to prescribe a high enough dose to be beneficial."
paxil,1,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,It eliminated my depression.,Constant stomach upset. Complete inability to climax.,"I was subscribed this to help get me through my separation from my spouse. While taking it, everything I ate upset my stomach.

It was hell when the time came to stop taking it. It's very addictive and I felt nauseous, dizzy and just plain horrible when I first tried to stop taking it. I went back on it and started taking St. John's Wart with it. This helped immensely when it came time to try to quit the drug again. After a few weeks of taking the herb, I slowly started reducing the amount of Paxil I was taking by breaking up the tabs and taking less and less of it each day. I finally got off it and will never, ever take it again. It was a nightmare."
prozac,7,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Before I began taking this, I had experienced a long time, chronic depression. After about one month of taking this I began feeling much better. Although things still are not perfect, and I have very blue periods, it has at least made life tolerable.","Reduced sex drive.  Had quite a normal sexual appetite before using this, and it has decreased dramatically.","Began taking 20 mg daily then increased it to 40 after 3 months.  Might help more if I were to go to some type of counseling, which I have not."
effexor,9,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,"I've taken various anti-depressants through the years, but this was the closest I ever came to a ""cure"". 
Granted, it was after I stopped taking the medication that this ""cure"" took place, but I never experienced this with other anti-depressants. While taking it, Effexor made me so sleepy all the time that I slept a good deal more than normal (10-12 hours daily). This is why I stopped taking it. But when I did, I felt better than I had in years. I remained depression-free for about 3 years. I then dealt with depression again for about 8-10 months (I didn't want to lose another 6-8 weeks taking the Effexor ""cure"" so I delayed, hoping I would just ""snap out of it"" on my own). When I finally conceded this wasn't going to happen, I returned to my doctor, who then convinced me to try something new, so I tried Cymbalta, hoping to get Effexor's benefits, without the side-effects. It worked well as long as I used it, but when I stopped, there was no ""cure"" like I'd had with Effexor. Now I take 600-1000 mg of samE. It's not as good as the post-Effexor experience, but I feel less dependant on the medical system for my maintenance, and I focus on physical health (good food, exercise, vitamins)to maintain my emotional health. Those things alone, unfortunately, do not completely do it for me, and that's where the samE comes in. It makes the difference.","As indicated in the question relating to treatment benefits; the side effects of Effexor, for me, were a tendency to sleep a lot, and to feel sleepy much of the time.","I began Effexor under the care of a psychiatrist who was treating me for depression. My depression took the form of a lack of interest in all aspects of my life and I had begun to ""shut down"" to such a degree that sometimes the act of just walking from the garage into my house required a strong act of will. When I had to run errands, like grocery shopping, I felt an uncomfortable detachment from my environment. My treatment with Effexor, at worst, sometimes simply took me down (energy-wise) an additional notch from where I was. At best, it shifted me from the uncomfortable detached feeling and elevated my mood a couple of notches above where it had been. I had moments of feeling fully functional. That was enough to give me a sense of feeling better, and the will to decide to take my full energy back. That's when I stopped taking it, and experienced the miraculous ""cure"". If I ever experience such a deep depression again, I will choose to try the Effexor again (the original, not the newer version), rather than the Cymbalta. With the Cymbalta, I would already know that the benefits would only last as long as I chose to be on it, whereas, the Effexor would give me hope for a lengthy remission."
lexapro,10,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,"I had hit the wall dealing with work, cllients,and family. My general physician asked me to see a therapist to help get me going in the right direction. After one meeting it was recommended by both caregivers that I take something to help me get through this rough spot. After about 3 weeks I started feeling like things were easier to cope with and I was making good decisions and getting things done again.","The only side effect I believe is some weight gain, approximately 10 pounds!!!!!",I take 1 lexapro daily. I have finished up with the therapist. I am feeling great.
zoloft,4,Marginally Effective,Severe Side Effects,"While I definitely did notice some improvement in my depression, I believe that Zoloft is far from being a truly effective antidepressant drug. My depression had somewhat subsided and my panic attacks were less severe, albeit not completely gone.","From my personal experience, this drug exerts its effects mainly through a total numbing of one`s emotions. I had become a zombie, not feeling depressed but at the same time not feeling any positive emotions. My emotions had been totally flattened. My libido was gone. I had absolutely no desire for any kind of sexual activity.","50 mg per day, in the mornings. Total duration of the treatment: 3 years.

zyprexa,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,Went from severely depressed before starting the medication to almost entirely free of depression a week after starting the medication; helped with insomnia.,"drowsiness in the beginning, but I quickly got used to it.","I entered a hospuital six years ago for suicidality; I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't eating (I had anorexia nervosa), and I was extremely depressed. I started taking 10mg of Zyprexa the first night I was there. I was really drowsy all the next day, but it waned over a few days (now it doesn't affect my energy level at all.) In about a week, my depression just lifted. This medicine has worked miracles for me- I've been depression-free since starting it- and I wouldn't go off it for any reason."
wellbutrin,6,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,The medication treated the depression without the sexual side-effects that accompanied several other medications for depression.,"Unfortunately, the drug seemed to correlate with an increased severity of a pre-existing condition: tinnitus. The tinnitus which was moderate to begin with became severe and ultimately led me to stop taking the medication. The tinnitus, though still present, is markedly less severe and decreased almost immediately after stopping the medication.","I was prescribed Wellbutrin, was on it for approximately 5 months and gradually stopped over the course of a few days."
zoloft,10,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,Depression free most days.,Withdrawal symptoms. Experienced dizziness occasionally from missed dose.,My depression is due to a chemical imbalance.  I have been taking some form of SSRI for 20 years and I'm pretty certain I will always have to.

pristiq,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"No side effects, other anti-depresson pills usually made me stop taking them because of the side effects, but Prestiq had none. I actually felt better after taking my pill, I was more bubbly and felt like my old self. I was also less aggravated and could think more clearly.",I did not have any bad side effects. The only bad thing I can say about Prestiq is it is expensive about $50 a month even with insurance. There is no generic as of yet.,I would take one pill before bed time each day. I have noticed as with other anti-depressants I would have to take them at bed-time or they would keep me awake. I didn't notice any problems with prestiq when taken in the morning.
zoloft,7,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,I immediately felt my mood swings and irritability disappear and I became a nicer person again overnight. My partner noticed it immediately and I noitced it in myself. I havn't cried at all and  although I don't feel depressed it's more that all my feelings have been numbed! I feel that nothing affects me and that I am better able to cope day to day.,The main effects have been the chronic fatigue. Although I sleep fantastically each night I wake exhausted and spend the rest of the day feeling like I have a hang over. I have no energy all day and find that I don't want to do anything all day although I do wonder whether that is through no energy or motivation! Feeling so fatigued also makes you so low and depressed so thats no help in the long run.Also my libido completely disappeared especially in the early days although it is not fantastic now.,Although this has been by far the best treatment drug I have tried in terms of treating my depression and mood swings and irritability at the moment I have chosen to withdraw from the drug due to the chronic fatigue which was bringing me down and beginning to make me low in another way. I have been told by the professionals that I have a chemical inbalance and that I have to take the anti-depressants like a diabetic has to take their insulin but for the moment I have chosen to have a moment drug free to find out what sort of person I am! I suspect I will last only a few weeks. Of of all the drugs I have tried this has been by far been the most successful for me in treating the symptoms.
wellbutrin-sr,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"The benefits of treatment were a lifting of depression, specifically as it relates to Wellbutrin, to elevate the ceiling of emotions. It also had a midly energizing effect.",Very occassionally a racing feeling if I took the two doses too close together.,"I've used wellbutrin in combination with other anti-depressants, but it is usually the other one (Zoloft, Prozac, Effexor) that loses it's effect after time. Wellbutrin has remained consistently reliable and contributes to the livlier aspects of mood elevation for me."
prozac,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"In general, I have enjoyed daily happy moods and more energy. I am able to focus on tasks better and can accomplish more each day. Mood swings, irritability, and temper outbursts are rare. I have gone from below-average to above-average coping skills. Feelings of worthlessness and suicidal thoughts no longer occur.",Increased thirst and decreased libido.,"Before Prozac, for many years I was unable to experience sustained happiness or control my mood. I was irritable at least 10 days each month, had uncontrollable racing thoughts, experienced frequent temper outbursts, felt hopeless and worthless, did not view life as worthwhile, thought about suicide often and made several attempts. There was no joy in my life and I suffered from delibitating migraine headaches 5 or 6 times per year. When I went to the doctor, I was unable to stop thinking about suicide. My doctor put me on Prozac, 20 mg each a.m. and I improved dramatically in a few weeks. After 6 months, I felt like I was slipping back a little, so the doctor increased my dose to 40 mg each morning. As long as I take the Prozac, I am happy and stable and have maybe one migraine a year. About once a year I try to reduce the Prozac to 20 mg, but within 1 week symptoms begin to recur so I resume 40 mg daily."
effexor,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,none,violent sickness and tics,effexor was for the depressioin part of a treatment plan to maintain stability in bipolar
cymbalta,7,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,The benefits are less depression and better mood. It took about two weeks until I started to feel better but now I feel I may need something a bit stronger as I feel I am too used to taking this medication. I plan to ask for a higher dosage or different medication.,Really none.,I don't really know what the details would be except that I started with 20mg and was increased to 30mg within two weeks.
serzone,3,Marginally Effective,Severe Side Effects,Lessened depression,It made me groggy during the day & made me sleep the sleep of the dead at night (not such a bad side effect).  I also had dry mouth & it sometimes caused mild nausea on an empty stomach.,"I took this med after trying others for depression.  It worked pretty well.  I decided to taper my dose down when I got pregnant & was off completely when my son was about one month old.  Since then, I have kept my depression under control effectively through diet & exercise."
paxil-cr,4,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"It reduced some of the side effects of depression such as insomnia, frequent crying and feelings of hopeless.","Weight gain (25 lbs.), difficulty concentrating, cravings for carbohydrates, lack of interest in sex.","Withdrawing from the drug was done slowly, with a gradual reduction over a six week period. Treatment was accompanied by talk therapy. The withdrawal from the drug itself was difficult, as it led to the emergence of anxiety and panic attacks and a new case of mild depression."
lexapro,8,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,Lexapro seemed to work well for me.  I suffered from panic attacks in the past and the Lexapro definitely helped with these.  The Lexapro also assisted with symptoms of depression.,did not have any treatment side effects,My doctor started me on a very low dose to treat some situational depression and panic attacks.  The 10mg did not work well enough and eventually I was given 15 and then 20.  The 20mg seemed to do the trick without any additional side effects.
prozac,7,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"checking myself considerably less, calm my mood swings, helped me think alot clearer,","when I first started them I had stomach cramp, also insomnia for the first week or so, and also got mood swings! which was strange because they got worse for the first few weeks.",one tablet once a day administered oraly
wellbutrin,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"The drug worked on reducing/eliminating my situational feelings of depression.  Initially, it increased my energy and focus, and stopped the feelings of sadness.  It did not make me feel like a ""zombie"" and I felt connected to my emotions and the people around me, which I had heard was a side effect of other anti-depressants.","At first I had crazy dreams, whch wasn't so bad.  I did not have any trouble falling asleep.  I had very high energy for the first 2 weeks, then it tapered off back to normal.  I wish the energy had remained.  I did not lose any weight, which I was hoping for...but I did not gain any either, so that was positive.","I started on 150 mg for 2 weeks on the brand name drug once a day.  It seemed like as soon as I was switched to the generic 300mg, the energy and focus benefits stopped.  There is no way to know if it was the switch to generic or just my body getting used to the drug, but it was dissapointing.  I really enjoyed the energy.  I weaned myself off after 1 year because I didn't need it anymore.  I did not have any significant withdrawal symptoms.  Overall it was a positive experience, although I was glad to not need it anymore."
adderall,5,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"Increased productivity, ability to stay awake during the day.",Dry lips & mouth.  Teeth grinding.  Tough time sleeping.  Highly addictive.,This was used in conjunction with Lexapro for depression.  I started taking it to keep myself awake (drowsiness as a side effect of the LExapro).  However I quickly lost about 10 lbs and couldn't stop moving around.  Eventually my thinking became jumbled (I don't have ADD).  I was constantly thinking in circles.
lexapro,2,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,less depression/anxiety,weight gain of 13 pounds -- very distressing.,"I stopped taking the Lexapro and have been trying to manage my depression on my own with yoga, light therapy, supplements which has only been mildly effective."
citalopram,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Until 10 days ago never took an anti-depressant, GP encouraged me due to my fatigue, low mood, agitation and within 4-5 days I found myself much more laid back and smiling at people more, usually because something is said and I see a funny side to it.  I know it ism supposed to take 6 weeks to work but I am changed or else back to myself.  My husband is pleased as I have stopped shouting at him at the least thing.  I have more energy and much more optimistic","palpitations at times, slight dizziness but decreasing each day",10mg per day
paxil,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,I have had excellent results with the drug.  I no longer have a negative or indifferent attitude towards life.  I am generally content and am capable of enjoyment.  I am still capable of feeling appropriate negative emotions but don't get stuck in them.,I am not aware of any side effects.,"I was diagnosed with mild chronic depression.  I took Prozac for approximately two years but it began to no longer work, even after raising the dosage.  My doctor switched to Paxil.  I tried getting off of it on two occasions, but both times, after about two months, the depression returned.  Paxil continues to work for me; however, I am concerned about potential long-term side effects."
wellbutrin-xl,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,I dont have days that seem so dark that there is no hope for the future any more. If I am up set about something I can still function and not spend time hibernating and not functioning. I sleep regularly where before I had nights where I would not get any sleep at all. Activities are more enjoyable. I enjoy life more.,have not noticed any side effects  the only effects I notice are positive. Has not effected my sex drive and satisfaction that other anti depressants have in the past. Don't have problems with a dry mouth like other anti depressants have in the past.

cymbalta,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,Worked very well to relieve depression and anxiety.  Left me feeling overall much calmer and more content.  Little things just wouldn't bother me anymore.  I stopped caring about things that used to upset me.,"At first nausea, decreased appetite, dizziness, lightheadedness, and a sort of ""high"" or ""stoned"" feeling.  These disappeared after several weeks.  Libido also slightly decreased, though not as bad as with other anitdepressants.",Took medication as prescribed.
diazepam,3,Marginally Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"I found that I actually felt worse rather than better, the only benefit was that with  imovane I could sleep at night which I couldn't do earlier. I never really felt rested though. I am not sure if the combination of these 3 drugs caused my anxiety to become worse. Venlafaxine was supposed to help my depression but I found it totally ineffective. I am wondering if I get a higher dose will it help but I am afraid it might make it worse . WOuld love to go off all of these medicines as I feel the side effects are worse than the depression","No energy, increase in anxiety and depression","Morning Venlafaxine - 225 mg
night before going to bed - diazepam 2mg and imovane 7.5 mg"
sarafem,4,Marginally Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"It kept me at a low-functioning level (work and occassional activities), which was an improvement for me.  It kept me functioning due to decreased depression.  I had taken it for a few years on and off before finally switching to another drug two days ago due to the drug becomming no longer effective.  When I was younger and the drug was new to me it was much more effective.","Reduced libido
Stopped working after several years, even after dosage increases","40 mg of and on for years, then increased to 60 mg four months ago due to worsening depression.  I am being switched to another medication as this drug is no longer effective."
sarafem,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"stabilized mood, allowed for clearer thinking, improved sleep pattern, felt less anxious, made world look bright again.",none -- no weight loss unfortunately,"Started with 20 mg once daily. This worked for several years. When spouse endured 3 years of life-threatening illness, the dosage was increased to 40 mg taken as 2 20mg pills."
lexapro,6,Marginally Effective,No Side Effects,"The treatment benefits were marginal at best.  Mood neither improved nor deteriorated, and anxiety was never significantly alleviated.  Unsurprisingly, recent research suggests that SSRIs are only effective in the most severe of cases.","On the plus side, I experienced no major side effects.  The possible effects can range from nausea to sexual dysfunction, but none were a problem.  However, it is possible to feel a sort of withdrawal.","The pills are administered once a day, daily, for as long as you think it's worth taking them.  The prescribing physician recommended taking Lexapro for at least six months to get the full benefit of its normalizing effects."
emsam,9,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,"More energy, clearer mind, no depression.","Sleeping was impossible for the first few weeks, but faded in time.","Once daily patch. Adheres well, stays on, minor redness after patch removal on very sensitive skin, but goes away quickly. Patch must be applied to a different defined (by the manufacturer) area everyday."
neurontin,8,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"Neurontin coupled with a stimulant such as caffeine gave me a warm sense of well being and evenness.  However, the drug acted merely as a Novocaine to numb my depression and did nothing to help correct my brain chemistry.  That said, it was an effective enough band-aid that I suffered the sexual side effects in order to take it as prescribed.","Sexual side effects included inability to achieve a full erection (when summoned) and inability to orgasm/ejaculate.

Softening of the stool- this problem lessened when I switched from tablets to capsules.

Memory problems and difficulty speaking.","I was prescribed Neurontin for severe depression in 8/09.  As of 9/10, I am still taking it but considering ECT."
prozac,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"My mood was stablized, and I was able to take advantage of cognitive therapy.  Without the medication, I was not able to benefit from CT.",Mild sexual dysfunction;  nothing else.,"I took 20 mg. of Prozac once per day, in one tablet.  It took about 6 weeks for the drug to reach its peak effectiveness, which is one of the drawbacks of this anti-depressant therapy.  I tried others, but they didn't work nearly as well as Prozac."
wellbutrin-xl,8,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,Helped with depression - did nothing for anxiety I did help me with my fear of crowds. It also helped me with my hopelessness I had been encountering.,"Anxiety - Seemed to make me nervous and to make me irritable at times. It did not, however, decrease my appetite which is does for many people who take it.",Given for major depression.  One 150mg pill per day.  I still take the same dosage as I started out on.  I am afraid to up my dose because Wellbutrin can cause seizures in many people.
effexor,5,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,I'm not entirely sure it was effective at all.,It was really difficult to quite taking Effexor.  I had all kinds of panic attacks and severe depression when trying to quite.  I must have tried to quite a dozen times.  I think this is a dangerous drug.,I took Effexor once daily at bedtime for 3 years.
lexapro,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,It was suspose to help ease my depression issues that happend when the biploar side of me was not in hyper. It was a new drug it was suspose to be very effeect. Not cause any weight gain. With very little side effects.,I had very bads nightmares for about two nights. The nightmare wre of me hurting my family. I could see myself killing my family it seemed so very real to me I have never experienced any thing like that before in my life. I told my husband to stay up and please watch me to make sure do not do any thing.So I did not take them any more,I was to take one 10mg pill at night before I go to bed every night. It did not matter if it was taken with food or with out food. Either way was fine. I had to take it at the same time every night. I was not suspose ot stop treatment unless my doctor said it was ok.
wellbutrin,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"I feel much better emotionally.  I was unable to get out of bed before I started treatment, and now I am back to having an interest in life.  It doesn't make me nauseous, which is a huge plus as far as I'm concerned.  I like that it doesn't cause weight gain or sexual side effects.
I was happy that it only made me feel mildly nauseous for a day or so.  I feel nearly back to normal emotionally.  I was concerned that it made my hands quite shaky for awhile, but after a reduced my caffeine intake, that subsided.  My only complaint is that it makes my ears ring.  All the time.  It is generally easy to ignore during the day, but I have found that I need a fan and a white noise machine set to a high pitch sound (like crickets) in order to be able to ignore it enough to sleep.","It did make me mildly nauseous for the first day that I was on it. After that, all good.  It made my hands very shaky for awhile, but that seems to have subsided for the most part, particularly since I cut my caffeine intake.  Given that it's an amphetamine derivative, it make since that adding another stimulant might lead to side effects.   

My only complaint is that it makes my ears ring.  All the time.  It is generally easy to ignore during the day, but I have found that I need a fan and a white noise machine set to a high pitch sound (like crickets) in order to be able to ignore it enough to sleep.",Started out on one extended release tablet at 150 mg once per day.  After 4 weeks bumped up to 300 mg dose.
wellbutrin-xl,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Helped my depression considerably.  Also, out of all depression medication I have taken since 1994, I have been able to stop taking Wellbutrin the longest before depression symptoms returned, so I believe eventually I may be able to stop taking Wellbutrin and not have depression symptoms return.","Basically no side effects that I have noticed.  Possibly slightly decreased sex drive but nothing compared to other depression medications I have taken.  Does not cause weight gain, and may actually cause minimal weight loss.  Supposedly may act as stimulant so recommended to take in the a.m.  I have noticed maybe slight stimulant effect.",I pill daily.  I take the medication in the a.m.
zoloft,7,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"Our home was destroyed in the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. Before the earthquake, I was already experiencing depressive symptoms but was reluctant to take medication for it. After the earthquake, my doctor recommended I give the antidepressants a try for a few months coupled with therapy to get me back on track. About two weeks later, I found myself feeling good again, (in spite of my therapist telling me how screwed up my family was) driving down the freeway, singing at the top of my lungs and playing air drums on the steering wheel of my car. The ""Old me"" was back! 

Thanks to the medication, I was able to re-organize my life and focus on moving ahead instead of being stuck knowing what things needed to be done but not having the drive or motivation to do them.","The sexual side effects ultimately led me stop taking the Zoloft. My husband and I found it very frustrating that I was unable to reach climax where before, I had been multi-orgasmic. Because our sex life is very important to us, this became an area of contention that I found to be unacceptable.  My inability to reach orgasm was demoralizing for my husband feeling he could no longer please me and for me the frustration of it all made sex seem like too much work to bother with. My libido came to a screeching halt. This depressed both of us so I gradually weaned myself off the Zoloft and shortly thereafter, became pregnant with our first child. 

One other thing about taking the Zoloft was that after the elevated mood from the initial breakthrough of depression wore off; I found myself living life somewhere in the middle. In addition to the lows no longer being depressingly low, the highs were not as uplifting as before. I was, in essence, comfortably numb.

Other side effects were dry mouth, nausea, weight gain, and increased irritability. , although the later could have been due to the stress of our temporary living conditions.","My primary care physician prescribed counseling and the antidepressant, Zoloft. The plan was to take the medication for three to six months until I felt I was back on track and could maintain a functional lifestyle without it. 

I started with 25 mg every other day for five days, then 25 mg a day for one week, followed by 50 mg a day every day thereafter. I began therapy with a psychologist once a week where I was diagnosed with PTSD. Strangely enough, I found the counseling to do more harm than good in this case partially because it made me see my childhood for what it really was. I did not find that to be helpful at the time. Had I not been on anti-depressants before I went to counseling, I would have needed it afterward to deal with the emotional blows that I had to face and could no longer ignore that drove me into depression in the first place."
wellbutrin,8,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"Alleviated depression without lethargy, weight gain, a paradoxical effect, or sexual dysfunction.  Prozac made me suicidally depressed. MAO-Inhibitors like Parnate worked very well for me, except all of my favorite foods were forbidden.  Wellbutrin seemed to be the only antidepressant that lifted me out of my depression, and it had the unanticipated benefit of getting me to quit smoking -- I went from smoking a pack of Camels a day to not smoking.","I often would get pounding headaches, in the front of my skull and at the sides, especially as the day wore on.  I also would feel sick to my stomach early in the day, which would be exacerbated by coffee.  I got tremors. Occasionally I'd get migaines.","I took 2 100 mg of the Wellbutrin, 20mg of Ritalin and a 10 mg of a beta blocker (I can't remember the name) in the morning.  Then at 3 I took the other 200 mg of the Wellbutrin; at night I took the Serzone (before it was yanked from the market) and the Trazodone.  I took a drug holiday from the Ritalin over the weekend, but over the years I eventually increased the dosage to 35mg of Ritalin in the morning."
citalopram,7,Moderately Effective,Severe Side Effects,Patient was more mellow and not as angry or argumentative. Also suicidal ideation went away. Patient was able to keep a job for longer than one year and not get fired due to bad attitude.,"Absolute loss of libido, lack of interest in sex. Extreme night sweats. Weird body odor. Ability to sleep for 12+ hours a night.",The patient took the drug in the morning with breakfast.
effexor-xr,1,Ineffective,Severe Side Effects,None.,"I was desperate to feel better, but after the first pill was swallowed, I felt physically and mentally awful. I had palpitations, nausea, uncontrolable shaking, severe headache and felt strangely detatched from the world (it was as if I was watching the world through a dense fog).","This was my Psychiatrist and GP`s last hope of treating my depression with medication, and I was told that I probably would suffer no adverse effects (""very rare"", apparently). However, after telling them at my appointment a month after starting Effexor XR, I was told that dissociative symptoms of PTSD are rarely made worse by effexor."
zoloft,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Leveled out my affect, helped me sleep and wake up more refreshed, minimized angry or generally emotional outbursts with my children and husband.","Nausea, dry mouth, decrease in sexual desire and ability to achieve orgasm.",Began with 25mg for 2 weeks and increased to 50mg maintenance that I am currently taking.
paxil,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Alleviated symptoms of clinical depression. Prior to treatment, experienced a severe episode of clinical depression that included acute symptoms such as insomnia, loss of apetite, loss of interest in life and people, suicidal ideation. After taking the drug for less than two weeks, I returned to a normal state of thinking, feeling, and functioning (which included alleviation of negative symptoms of depression and return to goal-oriented behavior and general sense of well-being.","delay in the onset of orgasm during sexual activity; a certain degree of loss of inhibition in social situations that occasionally lead to audatious behavior (e.g., what might be called as assertiveness in a previously shy individual, such as speaking my mind when I disagreed with something or someone and sometimes appearing rude or overly opinionated)","Upon diagnosis of severe clinical depression, was put on 10 mg of Paxil for a week which did not produce any improvement (was still debilitated and unable to think, feel, or function normally). Dose was subsequently increased to 30 mg which produced the effect described above (treatment benefits). Medication was reduced after 2 years to a maintenance dose of 20 mg, and a year later to 10 mg. A traumatic life event resulted in a subsequent episode of severe clinical depression. The dosage was again increased to 30 mg and again resulted in the treatment benefits described above."

effexor-xr,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,NONE!!!,"EXTREME fatique. I was not able to function day to day activities. I spent 14-18 hours a day in bed.  My muscles, joints & bones ached. The depression was not relieved, which probably a result of the side effects. I came off the drug slowly ( with help of physician) and now I feel great. The depression is still a possibility but I will NEVER take an anti-depression drug again.  I choose to have therapy and ask for the support of my family & friends",Slowly declined dosage and am NOW EFFEXOR XR FREE!!!!!!!
effexor,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"I enjoyed life again and felt happiness, I could hold down a job and look after my family. I was no longer suicidal. I lost weight because most of the time I was no longer depresses. and My overall health improved",For the first 6 months profuse se sweating and insomia.,I took 150mg of effexor daily. For 9 years I was able to live a normal life with some small episodes of mild depression now and then. The last 12 months the effect seems to be getting less and the depression is rearing its ugly head again and I am isolating myself and have to really try to fight depression. I am experiencing the well known  pooping out syndrome.I feel it is time tolook for another anti depressant which I am dreading.
lexapro,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"This drug was most effective in 'cooling' my anxiety.  The depression was less affected, but definately improved.  I felt much calmer and able to deal with my situation more effectively.  I wasn't panic striken anymore or weeping all the time.","At first the dose of 20mg left me a little zombie like.  I'd sit and stare out the window all day.  When the dose was reduced to 10mg. this side effect went away.  I also developed a clenched jaw, which sometimes I snapped and my teeth grinding became much worse.  I also developed ringing in my ears.  I also gained weight, a total of 25 pounds.","I was treated for anxiety and depression with this drug, beginning with 20mg and then reducing it to 10mg.  I was going through a divorse at the time and could not cope with the overwhelming crisis.  This drug was given in combination with cognitive psychotherapy and together I believe they were very effective.  I was able to be weaned off very easily after one and a half years and feel fine now.  The side affects were a bit troublesome and they remain; ie.  the teeth grinding and ringing in the ears and weight gain."
zoloft,1,Ineffective,Mild Side Effects,I had no benefits.  It didn't seem to make anything better at the time.  It seemed the depression was still the same and then I had side effects that affected me daily.,I suffered from daily Headaches and also  slight nausea every once in awhile. I also felt very dried out and thirsty.  It also affected me by lowering my  libido.,I was supposed to take a pill every morning with water.  I felt better once I stopped taking the pills and actually just started working on myself and my goals and then also wehn I started doing volunteer work to help children.
prozac,7,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"Prozac helped in toning donwn my depression. Prozac was effective for the first 5 years then my depression slowly started to become worse. I then had to be placed on Wellbutrin for about 2 years, along with Prozac and yet my side effects from Prozac increassed to the point where I was taken off prozac.",The main treatment side effect began as increased depression and slight shaking in my fingers and hands. Over time the shaking turned into tremors which I could not control. Then I was placed on Wellbutrin with Prozac and finally weined off of Prozac and the tremors subsided.,"I took Prozac once a day in the morning with my other medications. At first my depression was under control but after about 5 years the depression began to become more intense. I was then placed on Wellbutrin with Prozac and my depression soon was improving. However, I started noticing hand shakes which progressively got worse. So after 2 years of Prozac and Wellbutrin I was told to stop Prozac. Within 6 months the shaking/tremors subsided and my depression is now fine by taking only Wellbutrin (150 mg/day)"
wellbutrin,7,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,Lifting of mood.,"No noticeable side-effects from the brand name, problems with generic.  Details in next section.","I began taking Wellbutrin about 3 years ago.  At some point, I realized the generic was available and switched to it.  I did not anticipate any difference in effectiveness or side effects as I thought the generic was chemically identical to the brand, minus the ink used to print ""Wellbutrin"" on the pills.  It took about a month before I thought switching to the generic might even be related to the onset of irritability and subjective experience of ""heart pounding.""  I switched back to the name brand and the negative side effects disappeared almost immediately.  Also during the period of irritability (and pulse increase, I think, but I didn't actually take my pulse), I had a blood vessel burst in my hand.  This was not a surface capillary, but a deep vessel, that caused a bruise to appear on both sides of my hand.  The bursting was not associated with any trauma to the hand, but seemed rather spontaneous."
paxil,7,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,concentration and anxiety levels returned to normal were very good. Felt so much better on the medication.

i threw away the pills and switched doctors.
now i smoke pot. it makes me happy and there's no side effects that i was getting from Effexor besides the munchies ;)"
lexapro,7,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"happier, slept better. The Lexapro helped with energy levels and anxiety; the Trazadone with sleep. Together they worked quite well, I thought, as I was peppier during the day and slept well at night. So all in all, I would say that this was an excellent combination for someone suffering from sleep deprivation, which contributed to depression, low energy, and anxiety. I felt cured","groggy sometimes. And I could not really stop, though I was able to play with the amount of the trazodone, lowering it down to 50 mg. whenever ever I could. I did not notice side effects from Lexapro, just perhaps that I became flat overtime--not depressed but no super excited either. So at a certain point, I wanted to get off. I had wonderful dreams on trazodone, but would sometimes go back to sleep in the morning for 1-3 extra hours.","50-150 mg of trazodone and 20 mg of lexapro daily. I took all at night, just before going to bed. I would when trying to bring the Trazodone down--so I would be less groggy in the morning-- go very slowly, 25 mg less every few days. Usually this would work. If I woke in the middle of the night, I would immediately get up and take another 50 mg. I have probably taken up to 250 mg in one night, but very rarely. And I have had long periods where I was at 50 mg, only taking more if I was really stressed out or my mind was buzzling with too many details. I recommend this combination really."
zoloft,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,less severe depression. Lessoning of anxiety.,loss of sexual interest.,take one pill once a day
symbyax,2,Ineffective,Moderate Side Effects,the benefits were i was still depressed but not as bad and anything was better then that  all in all i should of had the anti bipolar med the damn doc thought i was bipolar,i had a racing heart beat  but extreme tiredness really strage  it was the worst thing i had experianced took my mind off being depressed but i didnt know any diffrent It was the first anti depressant iv ever taken i thought it was supposed to be like that,i think this med sould be for very severe bipolar and depression combonation  or i probably should of took the bear minimum dose  it mite of worked but not for me

I continue to take it as it has been the most effective medication for alleviating symptoms of depression that I have tried, including Prozac, Effexor, Wellbutrin and Lexapro."
sarafem,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"stabilized mood, allowed for clearer thinking, improved sleep pattern, felt less anxious, made world look bright again.",none -- no weight loss unfortunately,"Started with 20 mg once daily. This worked for several years. When spouse endured 3 years of life-threatening illness, the dosage was increased to 40 mg taken as 2 20mg pills."
wellbutrin-xl,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Within 3-4 weeks I had no depression and less hyperactivity; I was better able to organize my work and accomplish daily tasks; it regulated my sleep cycle. I told my husband that this must be what 'normal' (non-depressed, non-ADHD) adults feel like.","A small amount of shaking, mainly felt when drinking from a cup. It's not supposed to affect weight and hunger, but I have gained some weight, though I don't know if or how the medicine contributed.","Before using Wellbutrin I had trouble getting to sleep, then trouble getting up in the morning. I was very irritable, depressed and frustrated. I always felt groggy and could not 'get it together' until late in the day. When my treatment began, I started by taking one 150 mg pill first thing in the morning for a week. Then I took one 150 mg pill in am and one 150 mg pill in pm (this was before XL came out). The third week and from then on I took 300 mg in morning. I felt so much better that I was not bothered by the slight let down in the evening. However,I didn't feel really well consistently all day until the XL formula came out. I have tried the generic and I don't feel as well and I had constant stomach aches to the point that I was having pain near my gall bladder and was considering being evaluated for gallstones. All of this cleared up when I went back to Wellbutrin XL and I have not had a problem since."
wellbutrin-xl,7,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Elevation of mood and clarity of thought.  Progress stalled out at 300 mg, but with increase to 450 mg can tell the difference.  I'm able to finally think and plan ahead and chip away at all the clutter I've not been able to deal with which accumulated while depressed.","None at 300 mg.  Possible tinnitus from increase to 450 mg, not evaluated by an audiologist yet though.  Did experience weight loss (7 lbs.) at 450 mg dosage.",Initial treatment included therapy and Lexapro in addition to Wellbutrin XL.  Now only on the Wellbutrin XL.  I see the psychiatrist every 4 months for re-evaluation
wellbutrin-xl,8,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,"This drug definately does have an effect on depression.  I went on a trip and while I had enough for the duration of the trip, I ran out the day I returned and was unable to get the refill for several days.  I noticed a significant change in my mood and affect and began experiencing symptoms of depression again.  Although I tried to keep a ""stiff upper lip"" my husband noticed the change.","At the beginning of treatment I noticed a slightly elevated heart rate and I felt a bit jittery.  However, I do consume a fairly high amount of caffeine during the day and I was told to expect this by my doctor.  Another effect that I didn't really connect to the medication was a lack of motivation.  I did not attribute this specifically to the medication until I had a conversation with my best friend who had also taken Wellbutrin at one point.  She asked me specifically if I had experienced diminshed motivation while on the drug and it ""clicked"" with me.  I am not entirely certain if this can be attributed solely to the medication since this is also a symptom of depression.","Overall, I feel that my treatment with this drug has been successful.  I have not experienced any sexual side effects (which I know can occur with some antidepressants).  My libido is exactly the same as it was before my depression and before I began taking this drug.  I know that this drug can also cause a decrease in appetite as well as the urge to smoke.  My husband and I both smoke and I do smoke less when he is not home.  He is not on any medications and so he will frequently ask me if I want to go outside with him and smoke.  Usually (not always) I say yes for the companionship but sometimes I decline.  When he is not home I will smoke approximately 4 cigarettes in an 8-9 hour period (I used to be a pack-a-day smoker).  
Overall, I feel that this is a useful drug for depression.  I began taking it after my father died.  He battled cancer for 3 years and I took care of him the entire time.  His loss was debilitating to me.  No pill is going to change what I went through or how I feel, but this drug has helped me explore some of the painful feelings that go along with his death without ""coming unglued"".  My doctor prescribed this for me and at the same time switched me from Ortho-Tricyclen (which I was highly loyal to) to Loestrin Fe 24.  I must say that between these two drugs, physically I feel ten years younger (I am 33 but I feel 23 again).  Overall I would rate this drug as successful for me and will continue on it as long as my doctor and I feel is appropriate for me."
prozac,7,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"overal improvment in mood, cognitions and phyiscal symptoms. feelings of helplessness, worthlessness gradually subsided. Negative cognitions e.g. suicidal ideations were dimenshed, although it took a while for it to happen","Initially, in the frist two weeks of being of the medication patient complained of drowziness, sleepiness and feeling even more tired. However, the severity of side effects had slowely wore off.","After being assessed by a psychiaterist using differnt scales for depression, the patient was diagnozed with moderate to severe deprssion. The patient was then commenced on Prozac 20mg daily which was then to go up to 20mg daily. some side effecteds were reported during the firt two weeks, but they gradually wore off to minimum.

lexapro,8,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"I felt more stable in my daily activities; more capable of handling stress; and better able to successfully complete my daily responsibilities of working nights, parenting three children and keeping a house running at an acceptable level.","While I was taking the medicine, I slept alot during the day.  It could have been a side effect of my depression; however, I felt it was from the Lexapro because it was more extreme in the beginning of my takning this medicine and subsided somewhat after the medicine had been in my system for a while.  No matter how much I slept, I never felt rested and could still sleep a full night also.  This could also be attributed to my working night shift; however, once I quit taking the Lexapro, the need to sleep so much during the day subsided.","I was prescribed 10mg initially and this was not enough so my dose was increased to 15mg.  I would occasionally take an additional 5 mg, totalling 20mg, but this was rare.  I eventually weaned myself off of the medicine.  My doctor said that it would be acceptable for me to do this myself as I felt ready; largely because my father had died and my mother had remarried and we both felt it was going to be a temporary need only.  I took Lexapro for approximately 6-8 months."
effexor,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Yes would recommend this drug for people with mild depression,","Tired.......... I work a lot of hours! but I felt overly tired during the day.

lamictal,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Completely took away my severe chronic body pain. I was able to sleep at night and was not fatigued during the day. You have to be very careful with the dosage and slowly increase it, but it is completely worth it.",For the first night or two taking the medication and after increasing the doasage I had trouble sleeping.,"Lamictal saved my life. I suffered from severe chronic body pain for 3 years, and naturally I searched for a physical cause but was never able to be diagnosed or treated correctly. Finally I was diagnosed with depression and began taking Lamictal. I felt a 180 degree difference in my life immediately. I started initially with 50 mg and slowly titrated up to 200 mg. Now I can sleep at night, I am not fatigued during the day, I can complete tasks and have motvation, and most importantly, I am completely pain free. The number 1 cause of body pain in teenagers is depression, and many doctors fail to take that into account."

I do think that I don't feel it is as effective now as when I started but still feel better than without it and would not stop treatment.","At the beginning of treatment, I had a tremendous difficulty sleeping and felt jittery. Passed after a fews weeks. Definite drop in libido since treatment started, rated the side effects as ""moderate"" above for this reason alone.",Take 20 mgs once per day.

She and I were both sensitive, angry, sad, and sometimes suicidal. I have just lived with it, not really taking meds much. I have to notice a difference in a few days if I am going to stick with something. My aunt told my sister that the people in our family do well on Paxil. My sister felt that it worked for her for a year or two, so I started taking it because it has reached a point where I have to be happy or die from stress. the Paxil had a noticeable effect on my anxiety levels in a matter of days, and an effect on my level of general happiness in a matter of a week or two. The doctor prescribed 20 mg which I just can't take because it makes me too sleepy the next day. I take 10mg which was enough for the first month. Now 10 mg is almost not enough, I can feel the anxiety there sometimes but more Paxil will make me sleepy. My 10 year old son inherited the family depression problem, he's been talking about killing himself and others. He started taking Paxil also, I have noticed a big difference. He is not angry so much anymore. It is helping us truly. I usually won't take prescriptions, I think they make people sicker sometimes. I will keep taking this stuff as long as the benefits outweigh the problems."

And this terrible feeling of pretending all the time, at work, with friends, that i was ok, had disappeared. 
Before getting pregnant, i was a bit afraid that i have to stop the medication by my doctor told me to go on, that there was no known side effect with pregnancy, so i went on.

lexapro,1,Ineffective,Severe Side Effects,"Placebo effects, I thought it was helping at first","Turned me into a zombie, incaple of feeling pleasure or any positive emotions at all.","I took the pills for around two years then heard on the news that many anti-depressants were no more effective than placebo. I decided to stop taking them, I weaned myself off over a few weeks. After this time I was a new person, the world felt real again, I was no longer plodding through life in a daze, I was so much happier, the things I used to enjoy I started to enjoy again. I am extremely angry that I cannot get back those years that I was taking various anti-depressants that turned me into a zombie who did not care about anything or anyone. I understand everyone is different and these may work for some people, but for me these drugs ruined my life, if you are taking them you could be missing out on so much, please consider whether they are doing more harm than good!"

Difficult time for me.  Cried alot.  Lexapro let me get hold of my emotions.  I felt that I could cope with the situation better.  The doctor increased my dose to 30mg after about 3 months.

In addtion to Major Depression Disorder, I also have Anxiety Disorder, and prior to treatment, I occassionally get into hyperventilation. I felt better after several days into taking Lexapro, and I was able to sleep better also.","I had nobody to take me to my doctors' offices, so I had to drive myself around. The sedation side effect was very strong on me, and I could not drive safely. My friends also made comments that my responsiveness had gone a lot worse at that time.  By the third week into taking Lexapro, I had to call my doctor and requested to have a different drug in replacement.","To treat the Major Depression Disorder and Anxiety Disorder, I visited my psychologies on a weekly basis, and my psychiatrist once every two or three weeks. The first drug that the psychiatrist recommended was Lexapro, and I started with the 5 mg dosage, after which I took the 10 mg for about three weeks. As mentioned above, I had to call my psychiatrist by the third week to request a different drug due to significant side effects."

pamelor,7,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,"This medication was greatly effective in alleviating my depression, more effective than SSRIs or SNRIs I have tried.  Also, the effects did not seem to wear off with time (over the course of treatment, 9-12 months) which I experienced with celexa and effexor xr.  The facial pain was also decreased, this medication is also used as a treatment for nerve pain.","One of the most unfortunate side effects of all tricyclic antidepressants for many people is weight gain.  I was 'lucky' that I did not gain weight, but I was almost totally unable to lose weight despite diligent nutrition and exercise.

The medication also increased my heart rate.  I was unable to take it at night (which is the common prescribing practice) as the accelerated heart rate would keep me awake.  Taking it in the AM seemed to work around this problem but may have caused some daytime fatigue/sleepiness (this is why is it usually prescribed to be taken at night).","I began at 10mg then worked up to a 50mg dose.  I had relatively good suppression of depressive symptoms at all doses, higher doses being better.  The higher doses did not seem to increase the weight gain/heart rate side effects any more than the lower doses (as in non-dose-dependent effects)."
celexa,5,Moderately Effective,Severe Side Effects,"For the depression it didn't make much of a difference; but it worked wonders for my anxiety. The edginess, nervousness, impatience, fear of socializing and going out of the house, completely disappeared after one month of taking it. My close friends even commented that 'I was my old self again'. I was much more relaxed and happy. It made me realize that I was misdiagnosed as depressed, when what I really have is anxiety. After talking to my new psiquiatrist, we came to that conclusion.",COMPLETE loss of libido. That's why I discontinued the treatment.,"I started with 10mg/day, for one month, when I started to feel less anxious, but not motivated or more energetic, as expected from an anti-depressive medication. Then the dose went up to 20mg/day for another 3- 4 months, when no 'anti-depression' effects were noticed, the dose went up to 30 mg/day, it made no difference either. I have stopped taking it gradually (20mg/day for 1 week, then 10mg/day for 3 weeks) until i stopped completely. Now I'm waiting to see how I feel, to see if I 'll try another medication, since the side effect described above was intolerable to me."
paxil,7,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,The treatment benfits were...I was able to over come depression with assitance from the drug paxil.

interest in daily activities, passive suicidal ideation, loss of energy.","the treatment resulted in augmentation of restless legs and induced weekly migraines. this required three additional medication to manage the side effects.
these medications also had side effects.","the treatment was started two years ago and was intially very effective.
despite causing augmentation of restless legs and inducing weekly migraines
a decision was to stay on the medication and treat the side effects. over
time the antidepressant effects waned but the side effects continued so I
am slowly being withdrawn from the effexor. the seroquel has had side effects
as well."
wellbutrin,5,Marginally Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"More energy, better mood, increase sexual desire (which was very low).",I had a moderate tinnitus which became severe as soon as I started to take the drug. I will stop taking the medication.,I've been taking Duloxetina (Cymbalta) 60mg for 2 years now. It helps with my mood but it doesn't take all the depression sympthoms away.

Then the trazadone was added to help me sleep.  I was always cycling into manic phases but they became more extreme and serious.  The Lamictal completely obliterated the mania.  I feel completely stable, happy and am very high functioning."
effexor-xr,7,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"Effexor was very effective at alleviating my symptoms of depression.  My mood improved dramatically, I felt happy and engaged in life again.  It also worked fairly quickly.  I began feeling the effects within the first week.","The side effects I experienced while taking Effexor were insomnia, rapid heartbeat and grinding my teeth at night.  Also, I found myself incessantly jiggling my leg while sitting at my desk, watching tv, etc..  All in all, these were minor and as easy trade-off.  The major side effect I noticed was a complete loss of libido and inability to reach orgasm.  Simply put, it was as if a switch had been turned off on my sex drive.  This side effect was the reason I chose to stop taking Effexor.","My physician started me out on 37.5mg/day for 1 week then increased the dosage to 75mg/day for another week and, finally, to 150mg/day.  After taking 150mg/day for about a week, I felt it was too much...my heart was always racing, I couldn't sleep, and I generally just felt ""nervous"".  My physician dropped my dosage back to 75mg/day and that seemed to work best for me.  I absolutely feel that the Effexor helped lift my depression.  However, I eventually chose to stop taking it because of the sexual side effects.  After being on Effexor for about a year, I both wanted and needed to have a healthy sexual relationship with my husband again.  I dropped the dosage back to 37.5mg/day for a week, then one every other day for about another week before stopping altogether.  I don't recall having any ""withdrawal"" symptoms.  Within a few days of the last dose, all sexual functions were back."
effexor,3,Moderately Effective,Severe Side Effects,This drug did have benefits in that it stabilized my mood somewhat. I still suffer from severe bouts of depression- mostly caused by the side effects of the drug.,"the side effects are sever for me and include:  rapid weight gain which is next to impossible to loose. Very high cholesterol which requires more medication (20mg lipitor per day)Debilitation sexual side effects: impotence and inability to reach orgasm.  Profuse sweating, indigestion, lethargy.  I am now severely addicted to this medication with no way to get off it. Any attempt to stop taking the medication leads to severe physical and emotional pain.",I agree that this medication has some positive effects but the negative side-effect FAR OUTWEIGH the good.  Its been prescribed over and over to me by lazy doctors not willing to help me find the right medication for my condition. Any attempt to discontinue the medication has led to severe and acute withdrawal symptoms.

effexor,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"The numbness in my arms and hands significantly reduced. I was having uncontrollable emotions of sadness, crying and even thoughts of suicide.  Taking the effexor helped me not only control my emotions but also diminished the intensity as well.",Initally when I started taking Effoxor it upset my stomach. I was taking in the morning after breakfast so the Dr. suggested taking it before bedtime which solved that problem.  I have been taking it for sometime now and do not remember any other side effects from this mediation.,I started off taking 50mg for two weeks then increased the dosage to 75mg for two weeks.  After visiting the Dr. after a month on this dosage he recommended going up to 100mg and eventually I increased it to 150mg.  This is currently the dosage I am taking.
effexor,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,The benefits of taking Effexor are wonderful. My mood has been so much better. I can function properly without feeling overwhelmed and or stressed out. I have recommended this drug to many of my friends who have had similar problems.,"The side effects are mild, but excessive sweating is one of them. I seem to sweat a good bit more than I normally did as well as sweat more than other people that I notice. Also night sweats have been a problem from time to time. Constipation can also be a side effect.","The details in the treatment are just as I described shortly above. I went to the doctor, they prescribed it and I take it. Don't really know what else to say here for the treatment details."
effexor-xr,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,The xanax helped slow things down and make everything less stressful. helped me to stay on a calm even level.,"unfortuntely it is extremely addictive and you can find yourself craving it, and everything can become a problem if I didnt have any.  Dealing with lifes regular ups and downs all became stressful if I didnt have it.  Had to stop taking it as soon as I noticed my behavior.",I want to say it was 50 mg. doses taken up to 3 times a day.  It was somewhat up to me when I needed to take it.  Mostly for anxiety attacks.
prozac,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"Within a few days, my mood, self-esteem, attitude and over-all well-being improved tremendously! I went from feeling suicidal and not being able to funtion properly in order to take care of myself or my family, to feeling better than I had since I was in my teens. I began to lose some of the weight I had gained from being depressed. I was in a wonderful mood and I had so much more energy than I had in years. My overall experience with Prozac has been perfect!",I have had no known side effects to this date. I do watch out for muscle cramps that last more than a week and I have blood work done once a year to ensure that my kidneys are not being affected.,"I started on 10 mgs. once a day and when that was tolerated well I went up to 40 mgs. This caused some insomnia and nervousness so my Dr. lowered it to 20 mgs. a day. There are still times I get depressed for a few days but that only happens once or twice a year and it is mild. I am looking at being on Prozac as long as my body toleates it, due to once being taken off I went into a fast downward spiral and had to begin again."
celexa,1,Ineffective,Moderate Side Effects,There were no benefits.  It did not solve the organic issues and created new problems.,"Firstly, this medication made me drowsy, and I often took involuntary naps mid-afternoon. Secondly, I had carbohydrate cravings, and felt hungry all the time. Lastly, after a couple of weeks I became weepy, irrational and anxious.  I can't imagine how magnified these symptoms would have been on a higher dose.","I began taking Celexa after Lexapro made me sleepy and hungry.  The Lexapro did indeed calm my anxieties.  It was thought that an isomer of Lexapro might be better tolerated.  This was not the case, and now I am off all medications for a short period to re-evaluate my baseline needs."
wellbutrin,8,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,the treatment benefits were an increase of energy and an overall increase in mood while not affecting the libido.  after 2yrs it stopped having the same affect.,no side affects from this med,took 2 75 mg bupropion and 300mg zoloft in the morning.
lexapro,6,Marginally Effective,No Side Effects,"The treatment benefits were marginal at best.  Mood neither improved nor deteriorated, and anxiety was never significantly alleviated.  Unsurprisingly, recent research suggests that SSRIs are only effective in the most severe of cases.","On the plus side, I experienced no major side effects.  The possible effects can range from nausea to sexual dysfunction, but none were a problem.  However, it is possible to feel a sort of withdrawal.","The pills are administered once a day, daily, for as long as you think it's worth taking them.  The prescribing physician recommended taking Lexapro for at least six months to get the full benefit of its normalizing effects."
wellbutrin,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"Stability in mood, easy to recover from burst of anger, help to concentrate",I have not seen any,"I had some mood problems, like being sad most of the time, no will to do anything, and most of it crying without a reason, like waking in the middle of the night and start crying. I only enjoyed very depressing movies where I could cry my eyes out."
wellbutrin,8,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,I started with a 150 mg dose and that did next to nothing. I recently increased to 300 mg and then I really started to feel better. I felt kind of hyper and for the first time in ages was able to go back to my gym routine. I noticed a decrease in appetite which in my case is great as I have about 20 lbs to lose. This drug definitely helped with my feelings of worthlessness and failure and with the crying spells.,"The worst side effect for me is stomach upset and trips to the bathroom, especially in the morning after I've taken it. The feeling of being all cranked up is good when I have so much to do (others say this wears off) but it also makes me feel a bit anxious and unable to relax. I had mild sleep problems, mainly early waking.","I'm really loving the increase in energy and the lifting of the black cloud, but sometimes I feel a little spinny. Since increasing the doseage I've noticed I've been doing more stupid things than normal, like almost backing up into a truck that I knew was there!!??"
pristiq,9,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,It has helped greatly with my depression. I had taken Wellburin for years and it stopped working. Pristiq has helped get my life back.,I had terrible side effects for 2-3 weeks. I couldn't think straight and could not sleep. My doctor suggested taking the pill every other day until I felt like I could handle the dosing. I am glad I stuck with it.,Feeling better
effexor-xr,3,Marginally Effective,Severe Side Effects,"Instead of curing my depression, this drug made me feel completely flat.","Besides the extreme flatness, there were not many at time of treatment; however, I had severe cramps and diarrhea getting off of it","I had been on Zoloft for 5 years with no problems. After a while it had been less effective, and my doctor cycled me rapidly through other drugs that did not work well. I had been inpatient for a week because treatment had been going so poorly. So this drug seemed better, compared to that, for a while, but gradually I noticed that I didn't so much feel better as that I just didn't feel anything at all."
prozac,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Taking Prozac has helped me to live a normal life. I was having a serious bout of depression when I first started taking Prozac, and the drug lifted the symptoms of extreme hopelessness and racing negative thoughts. I've tried to go off the medication but whenever I do, negative thoughts and the resulting emotions return. When I resume taking Prozac, the symptoms subside. The medicine allows me to challenge thoughts rather than react to them.","I have problems sleeping--not falling asleep but staying asleep. I sometimes feel nervous (that is, nervous energy, not anxiety). I'd also say that Prozac can make me feel numb, but it's better than being severely depressed. Overall, the side effects aren't bad enough for me to stop treatment or look for another medication.",I've been taking 40 mg. of Prozac once a day for about 20 years (I started taking it about the time it first became available.)
prozac,10,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,"better able to handle everyday situations without spikes in temper
I usually woke up between 3-5 times a night. With the Prozac my sleep was less interrupted. 
I also had less stretches of times when I felt depressed and just wanted to sleep to get thru another day. All in all the Prozac helped me to rationally look at my life and make decisions. My outlook brightened.",none,20mg prozac once a day
effexor,8,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,Significant remission from a major depressive disorder that had been present throughout childhood and into my adult life. One day I just could not get out of bed - the depression was so bad that my father took me to the doctor who handed me a sample pack provided to him by a drug rep. The Effexor was a life saving medication.,"I did experience some  taking ignificant side effects as a result of taking effexor. THese included major sexual disfunction, chrinic tireness, apathy  and a numb state of being. I felt that the medication made me feel like I was just zombing through work and social life. I did not have a sex drive and found that I did not have any motivation to pursue sexual encounters.","I did experience some  taking ignificant side effects as a result of taking effexor.

cymbalta,7,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Less pain, better mood",Constipation,Took cymbalta once a day every day
wellbutrin,5,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"mood improved slightly, mental energy increased slightly, but felt different than from a stimulant such as caffeine.","dry mouth was mild. Aggression was significant. I became very quick tempered, which in uncharacteristic for my personality type. Libido was not improved.","I have a ""slow"" brain. Specifically I have what soem researchers refer to as ""sluggish cognitive tempo"". Taking a drug that has some dopaminergic activity could theoretically improve certain parts of the symptomology."
sarafem,6,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"Releived moderate depression initially, and helped with anger and irritability control.","Sleeping too much, night sweats, vivid dreams, felt emotionally numb, cravings for carbohydrates and overeating, and had decreased libido.","Started on 20 mg dose for 2 weeks, then increased to 40 mg.  After 4 months the benefits decreased dramatically so switched to another drug, bupropion, but still taking 20 mg of fluoxetine daily."
wellbutrin-sr,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,It helped with depression and suicidal thoughts.  I was able to sleep better and deal with anxiety and stress better.,dry mouth was the worst side effect but since I should drink more water anyway it was a mixed blessing.,Effexor and Wellbutrin kept my depression under control - I took more during the winter months and less the rest of the year.
zoloft,9,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,"Onset of depression as a result of sudden spouse bereavement, ability to continue to care for children, run household, resume paid work, resistance of negative thoughts and behaviours",nil,"Daily dose, reviewed quarterly by treating GP, along with numerous grief counselling sessions, support groups, self help (positive thinking etc), regular exercise program."
prozac,8,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,Manageability of depression.,Slight weight gain.,Take one pill daily until no longer needed.
prozac,1,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"My depression was significantly alleviated.  I would still feel bad somtimes, but it never again felt like true depresion.  It was like there was some ""padding"" between me and the bad feelings.","There were actually no physical side effects, but I found that I said a lot of things I wouldn't normally say, and which I was embarassed about later.  Prozac made me feel like everything was fine, so I didn't take things seriously enough, and didn't take care of things which really needed to be taken care of.  I feel like I wasn't a good parent during that time, because my attitude was ""eh...who cares?...everything is fine"".  

I also had a very hard time withdrawing from it. I tried several times but fell into severe depression and had to start taking it again.  I thought I'd have to be on it for life.  However, once I managed to make it through a full week without it, I felt fine, and have never had to use it again.","I have a long history of depression but had never taken medication for it.  I asked my doctor to prescribe Prozac.  For the first week I felt the same, but I slept almost 24/7 and barely ate. After that I did get a significant relief from the depression.  Unfortunately, as I noted above, I don't like the way I acted during that time, and still cringe with embarassment and/or regret over things I said and did.  But at the time everything seemed so rosy, that none of my behavior bothered me.  Unfortunately, life is not perfect, and as adults we must take things seriously and deal with them.  Prozac kept me from acknowledging that.  Looking back, if I had faced my depression head on, and let it inspire me to make real changes in my life I would have been a lot better off in the long run."
effexor,5,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,"After taking Effexor for several weeks, I felt decreased anxiety and generally more stability in my moods.  This anti depressant wasn't a miracle drug but I think it did help make things easier to handle and, in general, neutralized most life experiences.","I don't recall any severe side effects other than occasional tinnitus. The more severe side effects became apparent after I began attempting to discontinue use of the medication. At that time, although I withdrew from the dosage in very small amounts over a long period, the tinnitus was quite pronounced, especially after any sudden head movements.  I often felt dizzy for no reason.","I'm not sure exactly what information you are requesting here but treatment started with a relatively low dose, escalating to a higher one.  This was done in reverse when I decided to stop taking Effexor.  In retrospect, I'm not sure how much it helped me but had I known how difficult it would be to stop taking the medication, I probably would have asked my doctor for an alternative."
lexapro,4,Moderately Effective,Severe Side Effects,depression reduced slightly,could no longer have  orgasms,"I took lexapro for depression, within 2 weeks it affected my sex drive and within 4 weeks i was having difficulty reaching orgasm, whereas my entire life I never had this problem.  My depression was only minimally relieved.  I stopped taking it within 2 months, because I wanted my sex life back, and luckily it did come back."
zoloft,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,Emotions were somewhat blunted. Less moodiness.,"Weight gain, extreme tiredness during the day, insomnia at night, bad effect on libido and sexual ability. Extreme lethargy.","I was on Zoloft for about 2 years total. I am extremely sensitive to medication, so I started at a dose of 25 mgs. and slowly titrated up to 100 mgs. I was unaware that this was probably too high of a dose for me. It subsequently caused me to start taking other prescriptions to mitigate some side effects. My doctor prescribed Ritalin and Focalin for the lethargy and fatigue side effects that I experienced during the day, and Ambien for the insomnia that Zoloft caused. I am still on Ambien to this day. 

The worst effect of Zoloft came when I tried to get off of it. It was total, utter hell. I have since found out that this is euphemistically called, ""discontinuation Syndrome."" 

I first cut the dose down to 50 mgs. and did not experience problems. I then slowly titrated down over several months until I came off of it completely. Over the next few weeks, I started experiencing strange, tingling sensations down my body, panic attacks, (which I had never experienced before), and extreme nausea - which became so bad, I lost 20 pounds in 6 weeks. This was all extremely traumatic as I am a type 1 diabetic who needs to eat to balance the insulin I take. The panic attacks got so bad, I had to be on Xanax XR everyday for months. I could not function normally or work. I tried to stick it out because I didn't want to go back on an SSRI after all the trouble and side effects it caused. I went to a MD who was also an alternative care specialist, thinking he could give me St. Johns Wort and I could manage with that until I got over the physical side effects of the SSRI, but it didn't work. I eventually had to go back on an SSRI just to function normally. I am on Lexapro now. I managed to be drug free for the first 40 years of my life (except for insulin), and now because of the aftermath of Zoloft, I am on Ambien, Lexapro, and Valium occasionally for anxiety. To top that off, the alternative doctor put me on a supplement that ended up being an anabolic steroid (which he called a 'nutritional supplement' and I ended up having to go on even more medication to fight the side effects that I incurred from that. All because of Zoloft. I will regret taking it the rest of my life."
